This afternoon I read something about Mathew Pottinger, and I was inspired by his encouraging deeds. He said in 2005, "Living in China shows you a nondemocratic country can do to its citizens." While his experience of repression in China had fired his patriotism, I've fired my anti-patriotism. If you really love your country and people, how can you ignore their sufferings?
