## Who I Am

A wanderer between precision and meaning—seeking truth in mathematical rigor and moral depth alike.

## Background

**Education**
- M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (2025)
  - Research focus: Uncertainty quantification in deep reinforcement learning
- B.S. in Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University (2010)

**Professional Experience**
- 10 years in data science and machine learning
- 7 years in quantitative trading and financial modeling

## Core Questions

I seek out thinkers who confront the fundamental tensions of human existence—not from scholarly interest, but existential necessity. Born into poverty yet blessed with intellect, I needed a moral law to tame the wildness within.

Kant taught me why we have dignity and our duties to others. Dostoevsky taught me how to love actively.

**Does the sublime exist? How should one live?**

Real understanding means descending into complexity, not fleeing from it. Mathematics gives us the language of precision; philosophy, the language of meaning. We need both.

## Why I Write

Writing is how I think critically. This space chronicles my explorations across various domains. I write to clarify my understanding—and to connect with others who take ideas seriously.

You'll find:
- Philosophical explorations of uncertainty, freedom, and moral responsibility
- Technical analyses of machine learning and trading strategies
- Commentary on literary and philosophical works
- Reflections on where rationality meets human experience
