This WeChat official account has been running for eight years now.
It may well be one of the best decisions I've ever made.

Though it has fewer than three hundred followers, and each article only gets views in the double digits,
popularity was never the goal.

Looking back at the very first "Prologue," it actually holds up quite well:
*to go beyond mere repetition, to distinguish order from chaos.*
And in hindsight, it has largely lived up to that.

I cannot imagine how I would recall the past without these hundreds of pieces.
Many subtle and delicate emotions would have vanished forever,
like a spring dream leaving no trace.
These writings have marked the passage of time.

## On Becoming Stronger

Along the way, I do feel myself becoming stronger.
As though Achilles' mother had washed him in the waters of the Styx,

I too have been tempering my own heart,
forging it to grow stronger.

Yet my very idea of strength has changed.
In the past, I thought strength meant a heart of stone—
someone unshaken, untouched, and immune to inner turmoil.
But I no longer think this way.

Now, a line from *Vagabond* speaks closer to my heart:
**"All the strong are gentle."**

Only the truly foolish cling stubbornly to exclusion,
priding themselves on never being "broken."
It is only the truly strong who can stand firmly on the earth,
embracing everything with vast magnanimity,
understanding the suffering and struggles of others,
and soothing the human heart.

## From Divine Truth to Human Goodness

This account is called **Zheng Shiqi** (正十七), referring to the regular heptadecagon, a name taken from the novel *Yingxiong Zhi.*
It means squaring the circle: the perfect circle belongs to the realm of the divine, while mortals can only transform circle into square, approaching it step by step.

I can see that, in the past, God for me dwelled high above, in the heavens. What I sought then was truth at the very limits of knowledge—the hidden reality behind the world, the sun beyond Plato's cave.

Back then, what we longed for was God's omniscience—the ultimate form of human reason, a symbol of mankind's pursuit of truth.

But now, for me, God dwells among humans, by our side. Even if human reason were pushed to its limits, it could never answer the question: "What ought one to do?"

It is no longer omniscience or omnipotence that I find most unattainable, but God's omnibenevolence. For once you understand the limits of your ability, the things you long for yet cannot achieve no longer wound you—you have done your best. What truly cuts deep is regret: the remorse for what could have been done but was left undone.

This is the curse of freedom.
And in my eyes, omnibenevolence means the perfect use of this human freedom.

## On Writing and Sincerity

As for what to write in the future,
I've wondered whether to shift toward more popular topics.
After all, writing with few readers can indeed feel discouraging at times.

My strength lies in cognition.
Not that I produce endless new insights in any one field,
but that I can sift through the flood of noise and recognize what is truly valuable.

So, if I were to write something of public use,
perhaps the most worthwhile would be popular science—
curating and filtering knowledge.
But I rarely feel like doing it.
I only write such things when I've argued with someone
and need to set the record straight.

I write only about what matters to me. But what matters to me is seldom fashionable, so it may never become popular. So be it. I'll treat it as play, nothing more.

> Better to be neither beautiful nor popular than to lose sincerity and originality.

## The Next Chapter: Conquering Fear

The next guiding thread of my life is this: **to conquer fear.**

If I fear writing with emotion, then I will write more of it—laying that weakness bare.
If I feel I have never been cool, then I will try to become cooler.
If I am always afraid of rejection, then I will keep facing it until I am desensitized.

# 时间的刻度

这个公众号已经写了八年了。
可说是我过往做得最好的决定之一。

虽然还不到三百人的关注，日常阅读只有两位数。
但热度从来就不是目的。

回看当初的《序章》写得挺好：
**超越简单重复，区分混乱无序。**
那它还是基本做到了。

无法想象，如果没有这百十篇的文字，我将如何追忆过往。
很多复杂幽微的心绪，就再也无法回想起来，直如春梦了无痕。
刻度了时光。

## 关于变强

一路走来，感觉自己确实在变强。
好像阿喀琉斯的母亲用冥河的水来为他擦洗全身一样，

我们也在锻造自己的内心，变得更强大。

而我们关于强弱的观念，本身也在变化。
比如过去，会认为心如铁石、不内耗不受伤的人才是强者。
但现在就不这样想了。

反而是《浪客行》里的一句话更接近我现在的心境：
**强者皆温柔。**

榆木脑袋的蠢笨之人才会顽固地排外，以永不破防为能事。
只有那些真正的强者，才能立足大地，用宏大的器量承受一切，
理解他人的苦难和苦衷，抚平人的心灵。

## 从神的全知到神的全善

> 公号名为「正十七」，出自《英雄志》。
> 取割圆为方之意：正圆是神的领域。凡人只好化圆为方渐趋逼近。  ——《序章》

看得出来，过去在我心中，神是在天上的，在高处。
那时我所追求的真理，是认知的极限，是隐藏在世界背后的真相，是洞穴之外的太阳。

彼时，我们所向往的是神的全知，
是人类理性的究极，代表着人对「真」的追求。

而如今在我心里，神是在人间的，在身边。
就算穷极人的理性，也无法回答「人到底应该做什么」这样的问题。

比起全知全能，现在让我感觉更难模仿的，是神的全善。
因为当你了解自己的能力极限以后，
那些虽然很想做到但是办不到的事，是无法再伤害你的，因为你尽力了。
真正能伤害到人的是后悔， 是明明可以但是没有去做的悔恨。

这是自由的诅咒。
而我心目中的全善，就是对人的自由这种东西的完美使用。

## 关于写作与真诚

关于以后写什么的问题，
我也在考虑要不要改写一些更有流量的东西。 毕竟写的东西没人看，有时候确实让人郁闷。

我的强项是认知水平。并不是说在哪个领域输出多少新东西，而是在于能从茫茫多的垃圾里识别出精品。

所以假如我要写些对公众有用的，可能最有价值的就是去做科普，知识甄选。
但我懒得弄。科普这种东西，只有在跟人吵了架以后，我需要去纠正他时才会想起来写一写。

我愿意写的东西，都是我在意的东西。
可我在意的东西，就没有流行的。
怕是很难火了。罢了罢了。

继续玩票。

> 宁可不美不善，至少不失真诚和原创。

## 下一章：征服恐惧

接下来的生活主线是：**征服恐惧。**

比如害怕写感性的文字，那就多去写写，彻底暴露出自己这方面的弱鸡。
比如感觉自己从来没酷过，那就尝试去变酷些。
比如总是害怕被拒绝，那就不断挑战到脱敏。
