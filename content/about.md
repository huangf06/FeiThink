# About This Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of philosophical and literary translations and essays. This site serves as a curated showcase of my work in translating and analyzing classic texts in philosophy and literature.

## Translation Philosophy

My approach to translation is guided by what I call the **"神意" (Divine Intent) principle** - striving to capture not just the literal meaning, but the deeper philosophical intent and emotional resonance of the original work. I believe translation is an art that requires:

- **Fidelity to Intent**: Understanding the author's deeper purpose beyond surface-level words
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Bridging linguistic and cultural gaps while preserving authenticity
- **Philosophical Rigor**: Maintaining conceptual accuracy, especially with technical philosophical terms
- **Literary Beauty**: Crafting prose that reads naturally while honoring the original style

## Areas of Focus
