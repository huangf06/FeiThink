# About

Hi, I'm Huang Fei. Welcome to my blog.

I write about philosophy, technology, and life — exploring questions that don't have easy answers and sharing thoughts on navigating the modern world.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Philosophy**: Explorations of ethics, existentialism, and meaning-making
- **Technology**: Thoughts on how technology shapes our lives and society
- **Personal Essays**: Reflections on life, learning, and growth
- **Book Reviews**: Deep dives into books that have shaped my thinking

## Background

I'm originally from China, now living and working in tech. My intellectual journey has taken me from studying German philosophy to grappling with existential questions to exploring the intersection of Eastern and Western thought.

This blog is where I think out loud, work through ideas, and share what I'm learning.

## Connect

- **GitHub**: [github.com/huangf06](https://github.com/huangf06)

Feel free to reach out if something resonates with you or if you'd like to discuss any of the ideas explored here.
