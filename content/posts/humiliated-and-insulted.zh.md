When watching Kurosawa’s films, I’ve always sensed something—this is Dostoevsky’s thought.

Take Watanabe’s rebirth in *Ikiru*, for instance. But it was just a fleeting question, without concrete evidence.

Until I came across the passage about the little beggar girl in *Humiliated and Insulted*. Before I’d even finished reading it, I was shouting inside: Isn’t this exactly the prototype for the child prostitute in *Red Beard*?

You can’t even call it homage—it’s wholesale reproduction.

Case closed.

My excitement was beyond words; I had to stop and revel in it for a while.

Look! My favorite film master also loves my favorite intellectual giant.

Actually, it’s not just films. I suspect manga artist Inoue Takehiko is also paying tribute to Dostoevsky in *Vagabond*—the monk Takuan is practically the incarnation of Elder Zosima from *The Brothers Karamazov*.

No amount of praise could overstate Dostoevsky’s greatness.

But tragically, having read *The Brothers Karamazov* first—that pinnacle of world literature—everything else seems shallow by comparison.

There’s an interesting comment about this book on Douban: When old Dostoevsky was still young Dostoevsky, he was basically a Maugham.

That was exactly my feeling after finishing *The Painted Veil*: Maugham is just a budget version of Dostoevsky.

Yesterday on Bilibili, I heard someone comparing Dostoevsky to Lu Xun as China’s equivalent. I was inwardly cursing—what nonsense, they’re not even in the same league. What gives Lu Xun the right?

Thinking back to when *Dream of the Red Chamber* was my favorite book makes me feel somewhat ashamed. Though *Dream of the Red Chamber* and *The Brothers Karamazov* were written barely a century apart, the gap in their intellectual depth spans millennia—they’re not even in the same weight class.

This really highlights the significance of literary criticism.

That’s why I bristle when people try to teach me to approach books with reverence.

It’s precisely the absence of literary criticism that wastes so much of our time on cultural garbage.

Many books simply aren’t worth reading. After *Black Myth: Wukong* became popular, many people hyped up *Journey to the West*, but in my view, later adaptations like *A Chinese Odyssey* and *The Monkey King* actually surpass the original.

These classics serve mainly as source material. Their intellectual merit hardly deserves praise. Some even promote seriously twisted values.

But back to this book. It’s one of the author’s early works, less profound than his later ones, with a simple plot about a woman who elopes and then gets abandoned.

But the villain isn’t the one who directly abandons her—it’s the young man’s father, a noble duke who was himself involved in another elopement and abandonment case.

When the duke righteously spouts the most shameless words in the book, I actually found myself amused by this brazen shamelessness. I’ve seen plenty of terrible people, but such frank ones are rare.

Many people I’ve known came to mind—I’ve seen too many of these egoistic types in reality, even ones this thoroughly rotten. Especially those with privilege like the duke.

Conversely, when the book says “There are many, many good people in the world. It’s your misfortune: you haven’t met good people, and when you needed help, you didn’t encounter them,” I have to think long and hard to come up with examples.

But though the villains are villainous, the author spends more ink criticizing the father who won’t forgive his eloped daughter—who clearly loves her deeply yet, out of wounded pride, hardens his heart to disown and even curse her.

So when the old father finally sees the light through the orphan Nelly’s tragic plight and chooses to forgive his daughter, his heartfelt hymn to love is especially moving:

Oh, I thank You, God, I thank You for everything, everything, for Your wrath and for Your mercy! And for the sun that shines on us again after the storm has passed!

For this priceless moment, I thank You! Oh! Though we are the insulted, though we are the injured, we are together again, so let those arrogant and mighty ones, let those who have insulted and injured us now triumph! Let them throw stones at us!

Don’t be afraid, Natasha... We’ll go out hand in hand, and I’ll say to them: This is my beloved daughter, this is my precious one, this is my innocent daughter whom you have insulted and injured, but I love her and will bless her forever!

原来我在看黑泽明电影的时候，就有种感觉，这是陀斯妥耶夫斯基的思想。

比如《生之欲》里渡边的重生，但只是转瞬的疑问，没有确实的证据。

直到在《被侮辱与被损害的人》看到小女孩乞讨的段落时，还没读完这一段，我心里就在大喊，这不就是电影《红胡子》里的雏妓的原型吗？

都不能说是致敬了，完完全全地照搬。

实锤了。

激动之情难以言表，不得不停下来兴奋一阵。

看！我最喜欢的电影大师也爱着我最喜欢的思想巨人。

其实吧，不止电影，我疑心漫画家井上雄彦在《浪客行》里也在致敬托翁，里面的泽庵和尚活脱就是《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》里佐西马长老的化身。

陀翁的伟大再多溢美之词也不为过。

但悲剧的是我先看了《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》这部古今中外巅峰之作，再看其他一切作品都觉得浅。

本书豆瓣的一则评论很有意思：当老陀还是小陀时，活脱就是一只毛姆。

这也是我读完《面纱》时的感受：毛姆就是低配版的陀翁。

我昨天在B站听人讲陀斯妥耶夫斯基时，类比是中国的鲁迅。心里直骂，这哪跟哪儿，不沾边儿，鲁迅何德何能。

想起我以前最喜欢的书是《红楼梦》就感觉有些羞耻。说起来《红楼梦》和《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》成书前后相差不过百年，但其中思想境界的差距何止千年，完全不是一个重量级的。

这真的是特别彰显文学批评的意义。

所以当有人试图教我以虔敬之心去尊重书籍时，我就很反感。

正是因为文学批评的缺失，才导致我们浪费那么多时间在一些文化垃圾之上。

很多书根本不值得看。《黑神话语空》火了后很多人吹《西游记》，但在我看来其实后世的改编诸如《大话西游》《悟空传》等是胜于原著的。

这些古典的意义更多不过是提供素材罢了。在思想性上是不怎么值得称道的。有些甚至可说三观极歪。

说回本书吧。书是作者早期的作品，思想性上不及后来的作品，情节也不复杂，讲的就是一名女子私奔然后被抛弃的全过程。

但是反派却不是直接抛弃他的人，而是这个青年的父亲，一个贵族公爵，也是另一桩私奔遗弃案的当事人。

当书里公爵振振有词地讲出一些最厚颜无耻的话时，我竟然被这种坦率的无耻整乐了。烂人见多了，但这么坦率的反而不多见。

脑子里浮现出了很多过往认识的人，这种利己主义的形象现实里见过太多了，甚至是这种坏到冒烟的。尤其是像公爵那样有些特权的。

反倒是当书里说”世界上有许许多多好人。这是你的不幸：你没有遇到过好人，当需要帮助的时候又没有遇到他们“时，我要想上好一阵去想个例子出来。

但是坏人虽坏，作者却用了更多的笔墨去批评那个不原谅私奔女儿的父亲，明明深爱自己的女儿，却因为自尊心作绥而铁石心肠要和女儿断绝关系甚至诅咒她。

所以当老父亲最终因为孤女内莉的悲惨遭遇而幡然悔悟最终选择原谅女儿时，他那发自肺腑对爱的赞颂才格外打动人心：

噢，我感谢你，上帝，感谢你的一切，一切，感谢你的恼怒，也感谢你的仁慈！也感谢暴风雨过去你现在又照耀着我们的阳光！

为了这千金一刻，我要感谢你！噢！尽管我们是被侮辱的人，尽管我们是被损害的人，但是我们又在一起了，就让那些骄横不可一世的人，就让那些侮辱过我们和损害过我们的人现在去得意吧！就让他们拿石头打我们吧！

别怕，娜塔莎……我们要手拉手地走出去，我要对他们说：这是我的爱女，这是我的掌上明珠，这是我的清白无辜的女儿，她受过你们的侮辱和损害，但是我爱她，我要永生永世地祝福她！
