The ones who unjustly scorn others are ofttimes lesser than those they scorn.

This is a realization I’ve come to recently based on some personal experiences and observations. The purpose of writing this piece is to explore discrimination, superiority, and moral self-transcendence through these experiences.

### **An Argument in a Group Chat**
Recently, I joined an INTJ WeChat group, and some of the female members kept using terms like “males” or “Chinese men”(a derogatory term) in a way that annoyed me. I pointed out that these terms were both racially and gender-discriminatory insults. Then, several women ganged up on me, saying I didn’t understand their context and was overly sensitive about language. Things didn’t end well, and I left the group.

### **Moral Lowlands and Jungle Law**This is certainly not the first time I’ve faced this kind of baseless discrimination. I was born in a rural village in Henan, a moral lowland and the bottom of the hierarchy of contempt. I’m so used to facing discrimination that it’s practically second nature to me. But this issue goes far beyond just political correctness—it’s been a lifelong moral struggle for me.

The thing I despise most in life is the arrogance of privilege. Some of my classmates, after moving to Beijing (or Shanghai), feel completely justified in enjoying the privileges that come with it. I can’t do that. I can never forget this one thing that’s always been in my heart: the urge to smash that privilege.

What really harms people at the bottom is not the lack of resources, but the lack of morals (or collective wisdom). People seem to live only in the present, with no concern for the future; they only care themselves, with no regard for others. And I can hardly claim to be a pure, untainted soul. For a long time, I too subscribed to the law of the jungle, embracing the morality of a predator. My strategy in a world full of self-interest was to be even more ruthless, to outsmart them at their own game. 

But the consequence of this is that you lose the right to criticize those who discriminate against you with their privilege. What makes you different from them? If their arrogance is based on power, status, wealth, or the privileges of education, and yours is based on your intelligence and talent—are these really that different? Aren’t both forms of privilege largely innate and difficult to change through effort alone?

This contradiction has always weighed on my mind, making it impossible for me to fully embrace the “survival of the fittest” mentality or to indulge in cynicism.

### **Superiority and Inner Worth**By the time I turned thirty, I’d learned to see things differently. When my mother came to visit me in Shanghai and was ignored by a shop assistant in a mall, I might have gotten angry in the past, but at that moment, it suddenly felt pointless. It was just a reflection of their own smallness. 

Humans are creatures that seek superiority, and whatever you take pride in reflects the height of your character. If your sense of superiority is based on things that have little to do with your own will or effort—like race, gender, or background—or on shallow items like money, luxury goods, or an expensive lifestyle, it only suggests the shallowness of your inner worth. You’re like a natural object, simply drifting with the flow of life.

What gives human beings moral worth is our defiance of and divergence from natural laws. This is where our free will and capabilities truly shine. Thus, moral judgment is highly individual. You need the full context of a person’s life to form a judgment—it’s not something that can be determined by just one outcome or factor.

For example, imagine a kid from a poor, rural area with limited access to education and an average IQ of 100 who manages to get into a regular college. Now compare that to a second-generation student from a wealthy family in a major city like New York or London, with an IQ of 140, who’s had top-tier education from an early age and gets into an Ivy League school without putting in much effort. Which of these achievements is more impressive and worthy of respect?

You might already sense that it comes down to percentages—how much they’ve achieved relative to what their circumstances would allow. Only then do we establish a shared basis for moral evaluation between people. Otherwise, what’s the point in comparing two individuals with vastly different starting points and conditions? If someone has already maximized their potential and made full use of everything within their control, do the results—whether success or failure—really matter anymore?

### Moral PerfectionThe previous discussion focused on how we evaluate people based on their achievements and external goals, which is the standard we use to judge greatness. But when we shift our attention to how people interact with others and ask what makes a person “good,” this standard becomes much more complicated and nuanced.

It’s hard to respect those who see themselves as superior to others. The more people try to show off their superiority, the more it often backfires.

For instance, consider the women I mentioned earlier who mock "Chinese men" and boast about no longer dating Asian men. In my mind, though, I can’t help but think: dating men from other races hasn’t taught you how to treat people equally or fairly. You’re no different from those you ridicule.

Or take the time I was chatting on Clubhouse with a group of Indians, and they proudly talked about how India is the world’s largest democracy. But what I was thinking was, democracy doesn’t guarantee you always do the right thing or stand up for justice. When I asked if most Indians supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the conversation became awkwardly silent, and they mumbled something about being "neutral."

Another example is my support for the causes of Hong Kong and Taiwan. But after repeatedly seeing posts on social media where people from TW & HK mock mainland Chinese as "Ch*nese," my support remains, but my respect fades.

All these experiences that trigger my disgust seem to hint at a deeper moral truth. This is reflected in the saying I came up with earlier: people who unjustly discriminate against others are often smaller than those they look down on. After all, you’re likely no different from the people you discriminate against, but by showing prejudice, you’ve added an extra layer of arrogance.

If you expand this idea further, you’ll see that everything seems to point toward a perfect circle.

If the standard by which we measure greatness is how high a person can rise—where we admire grand and extraordinary achievements—then in the moral realm, perfection seems to be the opposite. Moral perfection lies in treating everyone fairly, like a perfect circle. Can you imagine if Christ only favored a select group of people and abandoned the rest? Would he still have the same moral authority?

What defines your moral worth and character is not how high you elevate yourself or how strong your sense of superiority is. The true measure lies in your shortcomings. If you view certain people as untouchable or beneath you, it’s as if a part of you has also become worthless. I don’t fully understand the principle behind this yet, but it seems that all of our moral instincts point in this direction.

### Reflections on GuiltTake, for instance, the recent case of the Japanese elementary school student murdered in Shenzhen. Many overseas Chinese on Twitter condemned the killer and even declared they wanted to distance themselves Chinese people. While this desire to disassociate is understandable, but something feels off.

What exactly feels wrong? It’s the fact that this attitude misses the truth. The truth is, when confronting guilt, none of us can fully absolve ourselves, because we all share responsibility for the wrongs of others.

All I shall also tell you, dear mother, that each of us is guilty in everything before everyone, and I most of all.

The Brothers Karamazov

The world is one great whole, and each individual is like a cell within it. You cannot fully separate yourself from responsibility, even if we all have different roles in this world. This is why any understanding that falls short of this feels morally uncomfortable. You might partially agree with the idea, but you’ll always sense that something is missing.

### Practicing EqualityPractice the belief that everyone is your equal. No one is inferior, no one is superior.

I know this is difficult. How can I treat those who insult and harm me with the same consistency? And there will always be people I admire and others I despise—how can I pretend they are all the same and erase these differences in character?

I don’t have a clear answer either. What I propose is a "15% Rule": no matter how great the differences may seem, all people share at least 85% in common. Those striking differences we see between people really only account for 15%. No matter how much you dislike or disregard someone, preserve at least 85% of your respect for them, if only for the 85% you share with them as fellow human beings.

**Note**: 

Where does the 15% figure come from? It’s based on a rule of thumb I’ve developed after reflecting on several big issues lately. For example: How much free will do people really have? Are we primarily shaped by our environment? Can people change, and if so, how much? What percentage of people are truly able to break free from stereotypes? In my experience, the answer is much lower than we might assume. In many ways, people are largely determined by external factors—about 85%—including genetics, culture, education, and life experiences. Meanwhile, the influence of personal free will and choice makes up only about 15%.

无端歧视别人的人比被他们歧视的人更加渺小。

这是我最近对一些生活中的经历和见闻总结出来的感悟。写这篇文章的目的，就是通过这些经历探讨**歧视、优越感和道德上的自我超越**。

**一场群聊中的争执**

最近我在豆瓣上加入了一个INTJ群，群里有些女成员说话时动不动『男的』『国男』地叫，我听烦了就提醒她们这是一个种族和性别歧视的侮辱性词汇。然后就被几个女人围攻，说我没有理解她们的语境和上下文，搞文字狱。最后不欢而散退群而去。

**道德洼地和丛林法则**

这当然不是我第一次面对这种无端的歧视。我生在河南农村，道德的洼地，鄙视链的底端。面对歧视我可以说是已经司空见惯了。而且这个问题也并不是一件无关痛痒只事关政治正确的事情，而是我一辈子的道德挣扎。

我这辈子最痛恨的事情就是特权的傲慢。我的同学们可以在移民北京（上海）后，就反过来心安理得地享受特权。我不行，我心里有一件始终忘不掉的事，那就是砸碎它。

底层对人真正的损害都不是资源的匮乏，而是道德（群体智慧）的缺失。人的眼里心里好像只有当下，没有未来；只有自己，没有他人一般。而我也绝算不上什么出淤泥而不染的白莲，我很长时间信奉的也是丛林法则，奉行掠食者的道德。面对茫茫多的利己主义者，你的策略就是比他们更狠，更精致地利己，以彼之道还施彼身，在别人最擅长的领域打败他们。

但是这样做的后果就是，你从此就失去了指责那些凭仗特权歧视你的人的资格。你和他们的区别是什么？如果说他们傲慢的是他们的权力、地位、财富，或者延伸出来的教育特权，而你的特权是自己的智力和天赋。这两者差别很大吗？不都是一些先天性的而后天单凭努力很难改变的东西吗？

就是这样一个矛盾，一直横亘在我心头，让我没有办法心安理得地弱肉强食或者愤世嫉俗。

**优越感和内在价值**

三十岁时看淡这一切。当我母亲从老家来上海时，逛商场碰到有店员不理睬她，过去我可能还会生气，但那时恍然觉得毫无意义，这只不过反映出他们自己的渺小而已。最近在荷兰看酒时，又碰到年轻荷兰店员试图用高价红酒来让我感到窘迫。这不由让我感慨，傻逼是世界性的。

人是种寻求优越感的动物，而所有那些你引以为傲的东西都在彰显着你人格的高度。把自己的优越感建立在那些跟你自己的意志和努力没多大关系的东西上，比如先天的种族、性别、出身，又或者是些廉价的玩意儿，诸如金钱奢侈品昂贵生活方式，只不过显示出一个人内在价值的浅薄，无限地接近于服从自然规律随波逐流的自然物。

而人的道德价值就在于对自然规律的不服从和背离，这才是人自由意志和能力的彰显。因而对一个人的道德判断这个东西是高度个人化的，你需要了解全量的信息，才能有初步的判断，而很难是单纯靠表现出的结果就单因素衡量的。

比如一个边远贫穷教育资源匮乏智商100的山区孩子考上一个普通本科，和一个生长在北京从小接受优质教育资源智商140+半学半玩就上了清北的二代，哪个更有含金量更让人尊重呢？

你大概也能隐约感觉到这玩意儿还是应该看百分比，即他当前实际所取得的成就和以他的自由度所能达到的最大成就之间的比例。也唯有如此，人和人之间才有了道德评判共通的基础和价值，否则起点和条件天差地别的两个人有什么比较的意义。人如果已经把自己的潜能发挥到最大，把所有自己能掌控的东西都已经充分运用了，那么结果的成败得失当真还重要吗？

**道德的完美**

上面是针对具体的面向外界目标时的评价方式，即衡量事功的标准，是我们衡量一个人是否伟大的标准。但当我们把目光转向于如何与他人相处时，衡量一个人是否是好人时，这个衡量标准突然就变得复杂弯绕起来。

我们是很难尊重那些自居高位的人。人们越是想通过一些事情来彰显自己的优越，结果常常却越是适得其反。

比如前面提到的无端群嘲国男的女性，讲自己如何不再跟亚洲男人交往。但我心里想的却是，你和亚洲以外男人的交往也没让你学会如何平等公正地待人，你也还是和被你所嘲讽的人没什么两样儿，只不过你比他们多长了对奶子，仅此而已。

比如曾经在Clubhouse上和一群印度人聊天，听他们如何自豪自己是世界上最大的民主国家，但我心里想的是，民主也没保证你们总做对的事，站起来捍卫道义。当我问起是否大部分印度人支持俄罗斯侵略乌克兰时，他们就开始尴尬沉默了，说些什么『中立』之类的话。

再比如我一向支持香港和台湾人的诉求，可是当我在社交媒体上一再刷到港台人『支言支语』一刀切地嘲讽大陆人时，我的支持仍在，但尊重在减少。

所有这些引起我厌恶情绪的经历，都在隐隐向我们昭示一些关于道德上的真谛。这就是我前面自己归纳出来的格言：**那些无端歧视他人的人，往往比被他们歧视的人更渺小**。因为你们本质上很可能没什么不同，但歧视别人的人却平空多添了一份傲慢。

如果进一步把这一格言推广运用起来，你就发现，似乎一切都在指向正圆。

如果说人们衡量伟大的标准在于看他能在平地拔起多少丈高楼，在事功方面我们推崇的是奇伟瑰丽波澜壮阔的事业。

那么在道德的领域，完美的境地却似乎相反，**道德的完美在于公平地对待所有的人，像正圆一样**。你能想象基督如果只偏爱一小部分选民而抛弃其他人，那他还能有今日的感召力吗？

决定你道德价值和人格高低的并不是看你自己把自己抬得多高，自己有多么强的优越感，测定的浮标似乎全在于你的那块短板。如果你把一部分人视为不可触碰的贱民，那么就好像你的一部分也变成了没有价值一般。这其中的原理我其实也还不能完全透彻地理解，只是我们所有的道德情感体验都隐隐指向那里。

**对罪责的反思**

就比如说，前一段时间深圳的日本小学生被害一事，推上不少海外华人纷纷站出来声讨凶手，并扬言要与中国人割席。这种羞与为伍的心态完全可以理解，但后半截你又总觉得哪里不对。

那是哪里不对呢？因为它偏离了真相。真相就是你不可能在面对罪责时把自己摘得干干净净，因为每一个人都对所有其他人的罪责负有责任。

每一个人在所有的人面前确实都是有罪的，对所有的人、所有的事都负有罪责。

All I shall also tell you, dear mother, that each of us is guilty in everything before everyone, and I most of all.

《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》

整个世界是一个巨大的整体，而每个个体都是其中的一个细胞。你不可能单独把自己撇清责任，即使你们在这个世界上有各自不同的分工。这就是为什么低于这个层面的认知会让我们在道德上感觉不适，你可能会承认它部分地有道理，但又总觉得它在哪里缺失了什么。

**践行平等理念**

践行每个人都是你对等者的信念。没有人低人一等，也没有人高人一等。

我知道这很难。我怎么能做到始终如一地对待那些侮辱和损害我的人呢？而且也总是会有我敬仰和鄙夷的人，我怎么能假装把他们混为一谈，抹杀这种人格上的差异呢？

我也没有明确的答案，我设想的是**15%法则**。就是无论看上去差异多么大的人，其实他们都共享了85%的相似性，那些表面上看过去的天差地别，其实也不过就只占15%罢了。无论你有多么厌恶和忽视一个人或者一个群体，请至少保留85%的对人的尊重，不为别的，只为了他们身上和你共享的那85%的部分。

**注：** 至于15%这个数字是怎么来的？答案来源于我最近对很多大问题的一个经验法则。比如：人的自由意志到底有几分？人是被环境决定了吗？人会变吗，会的话，能改变多少？人群中有多少比例的人能超脱刻板印象？我凭经验估量的答案是远远低于人们自以为的程度，某种程度上而言人就是被外部因素决定了的，大致要占到85%的比重，包括基因、文化、教育、经历等。而个人的自由意志和选择所能造成的影响不过也就占比15%左右罢了。
