### **Foreword**This started when I saw a childhood friend post about the Chosin Reservoir on Christmas Day. I’m profoundly disgusted by juxtaposing Chosin—that symbol of extreme narrow nationalism—with Christmas, which embodies universal values. It’s truly self-humiliating; the superiority and inferiority are immediately apparent.

I haven’t written in a long time, so I’m taking this opportunity to empty my head. Starting from Chosin, moving through the Korean War to Mao Zedong, I’ll talk about China’s present and future, and about traditional culture and the Christian spirit. Much of this is basic common knowledge, yet even these basics have been twisted beyond recognition in China.

We should still spread knowledge and viewpoints as much as we can—perhaps it’ll help someone. Besides, what I write here isn’t easy to find elsewhere. Some of it is my own reflection, some are conclusions and judgments I’ve vetted through my knowledge and experience. These things are scarce and valuable.

### **Why was Chosin Reservoir a crushing defeat?**Chosin Reservoir was such a humiliating defeat that for seventy years no one even dared bring it up. Yet after some whitewashing in recent years, it’s somehow become material for patriotic education.

In the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, an entire army group (three armies) surrounded the U.S. 1st Marine Division but failed to annihilate or even rout them. At ten times the enemy’s casualties (the 9th Army Group’s three armies—150,000 men—lost over two-thirds), they allowed the Marines to withdraw in full strength, taking all their wounded and equipment, and evacuating nearly 100,000 North Korean refugees (including the parents of former South Korean President Moon Jae-in).[^1]

This was unquestionably a major victory for the U.S. military.

If you were defending justice, perhaps such sacrifice at any cost would seem tragic and heroic. But the problem is: does what you did have even the slightest thing to do with justice?

### **Why was China’s intervention in the Korean War unjust?**I find that many people don’t know that the Korean War started when North Korea violated the peace agreement and launched a surprise invasion of South Korea. “Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea” has always been portrayed as China daring to cross swords with the world’s most powerful nation, while the war’s causes are left deliberately vague. China’s motivation for entering the war was partly Mao Zedong’s misjudgment of American intentions, and partly to curry favor with Stalin. The volunteers’ entry into the war was utterly without legitimate cause—hence the awkward, guilty name. On the Chinese side, they call it “Resisting America and Aiding Korea,” but in fact what you opposed wasn’t just the U.S. military—you sided with the aggressor and fought against UN forces.

The motivation for participation was utterly dishonorable, and the war’s outcome is hardly comforting. The lasting consequence is that 26 million North Koreans still live under the Kim dynasty, still trapped in hunger and fear. Only heartless nationalists could continue to trumpet this as a victory. In Europe and America, the Korean War is a forgotten war. The “national prestige” that Little Pinks boast about exists mainly in their imagination, with no basis in reality.

My grandfather was also a demobilized volunteer soldier. I never heard him mention this war, so I don’t know whether he felt proud of it. But 400,000 people like my grandfather died meaninglessly in a foreign land. From the perspective of human history, their opponents—the U.S. military (or rather, UN forces)—can proudly say they were defending peace and justice, while those 400,000 volunteer soldiers died meaninglessly, fighting for the wrong reasons, paying for a dictator’s mistakes.

### **Why was Mao Zedong a butcher?**Those who recklessly disregard human life should be dragged out and held accountable for war crimes. But that old son of a bitch’s crimes are simply too many. Compared to his even more reprehensible later actions, the hundreds of thousands of war casualties actually seem not worth mentioning—completely overshadowed. According to Steven Pinker’s *The Better Angels of Our Nature*, which lists the top ten mass atrocities in human history, Mao Zedong ranks second with 40 million deaths—mostly from government-caused famine. Only World War II surpasses it in absolute numbers.

On December 26, the top trending topic on SMTH BBS was commemorating the 130th anniversary of the Chairman’s birth. I looked through the comments—a full 95% were positive. To quote one commenter: A butcher who ranks among history’s worst, yet people pay homage every day.

Chinese lives are truly worthless. Hundreds of thousands, tens of millions dying meaninglessly doesn’t even cause a ripple. The culprit’s portrait still hangs proudly on the gate tower. How did it come to this?

### **Why is China still a dynasty?**China today has a Confucian core, a Marxist-Leninist veneer, and a despotic soul. Dynasty—that’s the most accurate label for China’s current social structure.

I’ve been reflecting these past days. I always call myself an anti-communist, but does opposing communism really strike at the heart of the matter? Is communism truly the culprit? Thinking it through carefully, I find it’s not so simple. So-called communism is just a banner, essentially no different from Hong Xiuquan’s God Worshipping Society. The CCP’s rise to power was essentially just another peasant uprising, and Mao Zedong was simply the most recent peasant rebellion leader.

Today’s China is a dynasty just like the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing. Key economic resources are completely monopolized by the government and authorized top-down. Supreme ruling power is selected internally by the CCP elite and inherited internally. This is identical to the feudal dynasty governance model—the only difference is that the Ming and Qing were ruled by one family, while today is ruled by over 500 families.[^2]

### **Why is China’s underclass so wretched yet so stable?**Every now and then we see news about how wretched the lower classes are—so why don’t they rebel? This comes down to the urban-rural dual system, history’s most scientifically designed enslavement system.

The urban-rural dual system is a complete social enslavement system, a caste system, and an economic exploitation system. But it’s also the foundation of Chinese social super-stability—arguably the best political enslavement system in history. Its hidden harm exceeds slavery, yet it exists in a form more civilized-looking than slavery.

#### **1. The urban-rural dual system enables identity switching and class mobility for Chinese people, releasing peasants’ confrontational pressure against the regime**Peasants receive some land and shoulder state labor duties and taxes, but enjoy no social security benefits or retirement. Meanwhile, peasants’ agricultural products are subject to state purchasing monopolies—they cannot sell independently or set prices. This completely strips peasants of economic agency, reducing them to appendages of the Chinese economy, making them the exploited class.

But the system of converting agricultural to non-agricultural household registration (*nongzhuanfei*) is an extremely powerful institutional design. Through this nationwide system, the best talent among peasants is entirely siphoned off through identity conversion, allowing them to achieve class mobility—jumping from exploited peasant status to status that enjoys social security benefits. Thus, those among peasants with the greatest consciousness and capacity for resistance stand on the opposite side of the peasants through this conversion system, becoming part of the ruling base. The threat peasants pose to the regime is thereby eliminated.

#### **2. The urban-rural dual system is itself a class mutual constraint system—urban residents naturally rule over rural residents**In the basic design of resource distribution, urban residents get first priority, then peasants. This inequality in resource allocation directly creates a situation where Chinese urban residents are inherently one rung higher than peasants in political status, ideology, and social position. Beyond the government itself, there’s a powerful urban citizenry ensuring the stability of the peasant class—a critical factor in Chinese social super-stability.

The urban-rural dual system first divides identity classes, while preserving channels for class identity conversion, and achieves class constraint and balance. Before state machinery intervenes in lower-class crises, the urban-rural dual system itself has already controlled the crisis between urban and rural areas and self-resolved it.

The urban-rural dual system has become the ultimate code for Chinese social super-stability, and history’s most stable and scientific enslavement system.

### **How many years does the Chinese Communist Party have left?**I see quite a few Chinese liberals fantasizing that the CCP will automatically collapse the moment the economy takes a hit. I think we can abandon this illusion:

There’s no relationship between economic collapse and the fall of the Chinese government. Even if the economy collapses to the point of cannibalism, the Chinese government won’t fall. It might even gain higher support during such chaos and maintain effective rule for an extremely long time.[^3]

Both the Great Famine of the 1960s and the three-year zero-COVID policy have repeatedly proven this point. And the West has no interest in helping China rebuild order. What the free world can do to help China is this: as a point of contrast, they can continue to remain prosperous.

The super-stable structure of Chinese society and the loss of popular mobilization capacity determine the current governance model. Only when this organization’s self-functioning moves from weakening to attenuation to dissolution to collapse—this process is quite long, even 50 years is optimistic. If you don’t believe it, look at the fall of the Qing Aisin Gioro clan: from 1840 when foreign powers blasted open China’s gates to 1912 when the Xuantong Emperor voluntarily abdicated—over 60 years.[^2]

I often think: if China were to reform, where would it begin? Thinking it through, it can only be education.

Education bears the political mission of shaping every generation of Chinese people. Currently, education’s three domains—family, school, society—maintain complete consistency, fully extinguishing Chinese people’s spirit of resistance and skepticism according to political needs. If education could loosen up, that itself would reflect that other social factors had already changed first. And the seed of that change comes from the previous generation’s cultivation—without the previous generation’s actual change efforts through their own actions, the next generation will only repeat the previous generation’s footsteps.[^2]

But look at the Maoist leftist tide permeating society—clearly the new era hasn’t even truly begun yet.

### **Why is China still a barbaric country?**My friend captioned Chosin with: “Our peace and security are absolutely built on blood.” But what I’m thinking is: Our peace and security depend entirely on certain people dying at the right time. First Mao Anying, then Mao Zedong himself, and now the person everyone’s collectively hoping for.

But just thinking this makes me despondent. Facing despots and tyrants, you’re utterly powerless. You can only pretend nothing’s happening, turn a blind eye to the enslavement and injustice right in front of you, while searching for imaginary enemies ten thousand miles away. And you still fantasize about exporting your national culture? Export what—your cowardly habit of burying your head in the sand and picking on the weak? Or your scientific enslavement system?

There are only two kinds of human civilizational systems: those that have put power in a cage, and others. The former can be called civilized societies, and China clearly belongs to the barbaric camp.

Many people think we’re more civilized and progressive than Qing Dynasty people. In reality, we differ from Qing people only in having a smartphone, while Qing people differ from us only in having a queue braid.

In three thousand years of Chinese history, regime change has only two power sources: first, bloodline inheritance; second, violent creation. Beyond these, China has yet to develop a third—constitutional contract. Political civilization has been treading water for two thousand years. Chinese culture hasn’t broken through the interpersonal relationship framework Confucius defined two thousand years ago, the depth of humanistic thinking Laozi defined, or the three-layer heaven-ruler-people relationship Dong Zhongshu created.[^2]

I felt this especially keenly when reading *The Brothers Karamazov*, because before that my favorite literary work was *Dream of the Red Chamber*. But look—thousands of years down the line, no progress. In Su Dongpo’s time they sang “letting life’s misty rain fall as it will,” and by Jia Baoyu’s era it still hasn’t escaped that same old dichotomy between worldly engagement and spiritual withdrawal. Compare Cao Xueqin with Dostoevsky a hundred years later—the depth and breadth of thought are worlds apart.

Civilized societies are held together by love and freedom; barbaric societies maintain themselves through hatred and fear. And civilized societies, though religious influence has now waned, originated from the spirit of Protestant Christianity. Whether the Magna Carta establishing protection of private rights, or constitutional government—all arose from Christian society.

One could say that current Western constitutional democracy is the only system humanity has successfully tested for peaceful coexistence and universal human rights. Other civilizational systems have yet to develop similarly inclusive frameworks. Traditional hierarchical systems, whether Confucian or theocratic, were designed to maintain order within specific cultural contexts rather than to protect individual rights universally. If such systems were to replace constitutional democracy globally, it would represent a step backward for human freedom and dignity.

So in this sense, Christmas’s significance is far beyond anything that narrow nationalism like Chosin Reservoir could ever touch, and far surpasses the depth of thought represented by any traditional Chinese festival.

### **前言**起因是我在朋友圈刷到童年玩伴在圣诞节发长津湖。我实在是非常反感拿长津湖这种极端狭隘的民族主义，来和圣诞节这样具有普世意义的价值放在一起作对比。简直是自取其辱，高下立判。

我也很长时间没写东西了，借此机会清空一波。从长津湖说开去，到朝鲜战争，再到毛泽东，讲讲中国社会的现在和未来，以及传统文化和基督精神。很多都是一些常识性东西，可是就连这些常识性的东西在国内也被扭曲得不成样子。

还是应该力所能及地传播知识和观点，万一能帮助到一些人呢。而且我写在这里的东西，其他地方未必常见到。一些是我自己的所思所想，一些是经由我的学识见闻所鉴定过的结论判断。这些都是稀缺而有价的。

### **为什么长津湖是一场大败仗？**长津湖就是一场七十年来都没有脸提起的大败仗，结果这几年一番涂抹以后反而成了爱国主义教育素材。

**长津湖一战，一个兵团（三个军）的兵力围住了美国陆战一师，没有能够歼灭，也没有能够击溃，付出了10倍于敌人的代价（九兵团三个军15万人损失三分之二以上），让美军全建制地撤出战斗，带走了所有的伤员和武器装备，还顺手撤走了近10万朝鲜难民（其中就包括韩国前总统文在寅的父母）。**

**[韩战风云 @ihanzhan 2023年12月24日推文]**

这毫无疑问是美军的一场大胜利。

假如你在守护正义，这样不惜一切代价的牺牲或许还显得悲壮。可问题你干的事跟正义有一毛钱关系吗？

### **为什么朝鲜战争是不正义的？**我发现很多人不知道，朝鲜战争的起因是朝鲜率先破坏和平协议偷袭侵略韩国。抗美援朝一直被描绘成中国敢于亮剑跟世界上最强大的国家打了一仗，至于事情的起因则是语焉不详。中方的参战动机一方面是毛泽东误判了美国意图，另一方面则是为了取悦他俄爹斯大林。志愿军参战根本师出无名，所以才起了这么一个不伦不类做贼心虚的名字。中国这边一说起来就是抗美援朝，但事实上你对抗的不只是美军，而是帮助侵略者一方，对抗联合国部队。

参战的动机既毫无荣誉可言，而战争的结果也很难让人欣慰。影响至今的后果就是二千六百万朝鲜人还生活在金家王朝之下，还活在饥饿和恐惧里。这样的结果，只有那些没人性的民族主义者才能继续鼓吹是胜利。而朝鲜战争，在欧美是一场被遗忘的战争。小粉红们所宣扬的打出国威，基本只存在于他们的想象，而无现实根据。

我爷爷也是志愿军的复员军人。我从没听他提起过这场战争，无从知晓他自豪与否。而有四十万像我爷爷一样的人，却毫无意义地死在异国他乡。从人类历史的视角去看，他们的对手美军（或说联合国军）可以自豪地称自己在守护和平正义，而这四十万志愿军战士却死得毫无意义，为着错误的理由而战，为了独裁者的错误买单。

### **为什么毛泽东是个屠夫？**那些罔顾人命任性而为的家伙应该被拖出来追究战争责任。但这老逼养的罪行实在太多。相比后来那些更加混蛋的行径，几十万人的战争伤亡竟然就显得不值一提，完全被比下去了。下表节选自《人性中的善良天使》，列出了古往今来十大非正常死亡人数最多的事件。

中国人的命真是贱得很。几十万人，几千万人没有意义地死掉激不起一点浪花。肇事者的像还好好地挂在城楼上。何以如此？

### **为什么中国仍是一个王朝？**中国目下，是儒教的内核，马列的名号，专制的灵魂。王朝，就是今天中国最准确的社会形态。

我这些天在反思，我总称自己是反共分子，但是反共真的击中了要害吗？共产主义真的是罪魁祸首吗？ 仔细推想，发现不是这么一回事。所谓共产主义不过是打的一套旗号罢了，和洪秀全的拜上帝教本质上没啥两样。共产党的上台本质上仍然是一次农民起义，而毛泽东就是最近的一个农民起义领袖。

**今天的中国，是和汉唐明清一样的王朝。关键命脉性经济资源，完全由政府垄断并从上到下授权，最高统治权力由中共高层内部推举产生，并在内部传承，这就和封建王朝在统治模式上完全一致，区别仅在于明清是一家之天下，今天是500多个家族共有天下。**

### **为什么中国的底层如此惨烈又如此稳定？**不时看到新闻，底层人民如何如何惨烈，那他们为什么不反抗呢？这就要说到城乡二元制这套史上最科学的奴役制度了。

城乡二元制，是一整套社会奴役制度，身份等级制度和经济盘剥制度。但同时又是中国社会超级稳定基本盘，可以说是历史上最佳的政治奴役制度。其隐性伤害，超过奴隶制，但又是以比奴隶制文明的面貌存在。

#### 一、 城乡二元制实现中国人的身份轮换和阶级升迁，释放了农民对政权的对抗压力农民获得一定土地，承担国家徭役赋税，但不享受社会保障福利，无退休制度，同时农民的农产品被统购统销，无法自主销售与定价，这就完全剥夺农民在经济体系中的主体地位，沦为中国经济的附属品，成为利益被剥夺者。

而农转非制度，是一个功能非常强大的制度设计，通过这一全国性制度设计，将农民中的头部人才，悉数通过身份转换，让他们实现阶级跳跃，从被剥削的农民身份，升级为可享受社会保障福利的身份。由此，农民阶层中最具反抗意识，反抗能力的人，就通过农转非制度，站到农民的对立面，成为统治者的基本盘。农民对政权的威助，由此解除。

#### 二、城乡二元制，本身就是阶级相互制约制度，城镇居民天然统治农业居民从社会资源初次分配制度设计上，先面向城镇居民，再分配给农民，这种资源分配的不平等，直接造成中国城镇居民，在政治身份、意识形态、社会地位上，天然就比农民高一个等级。在中国政府之外，多了一个强大的市民阶级，来确保农民阶级的稳定性，这是中国社会超级稳定的一个重要因素。

城乡二元制，首先划分了身份阶级，同时预留了阶级身份转换通道，又实现了阶级制约平衡，在国家机器干预底层危机之前，城乡二元制本身，就已将危机控制在城乡之间，并自我消弭。

城乡二元制，就成为中国社会超级稳定终极密码，也是历史上最稳定，最科学的奴役制度。

### **中国共产党还有多少年寿命？**看到不少中国自由派的言论。真的是无数人都在幻想，只要经济稍有冰冻，中共就会自动垮台。我觉得可以放弃幻想：

**经济坍塌跟中国政府倒台之间没有任何关系，即使经济坍塌到人相食，中国政府也不会倒台。可能还会在这样的乱世获得更高的支持度，维持极长时间的有效统治。**

**[老蛮频道 @laomanpindao 2023年12月25日Freefrom post]**

不管是六十年代的大饥荒，还是三年清零政策，都在反复证明这一点。 而欧美也不会有任何兴趣来帮助中国重建秩序。自由世界能够帮助中国的就是：作为对比，他们自己继续保持繁荣。

**中国社会超级稳定的结构，和民众动员能力的丧失，决定了现有的统治模式。只有在这个组织自我功能，从变弱，到衰减，到涣散，到崩溃，这个过程相当漫长，50年都是乐观。如果不信，请参考清爱新觉罗家族的覆亡过程，从1840年国门被轰开，到1912年宣统帝主动退位，一个甲子还多。**

**[昆侖 @Kunluntalk 2023年12月14日推文]**

我每每想，如果中国要革新，先从哪里开始？思来想去，都是唯有教育。

**教育肩负着塑造中国每一代人的政治使命。 而现今，教育的三个阵营，家庭，学校，社会，保持高度一致，完全按照政治的需求，泯灭了中国人的反抗意识和怀疑精神。 如果教育能有所松动，那它本身就是其他社会因素已经率先变革的反映。而这变革的火种，就来源于上一代人的育种，没有上一代身体力行付出实际的变革努力，下一代只会重复上一代的脚印。**

**[昆侖 @Kunluntalk 2023年12月9日推文]**

可你看这整个社会弥漫的毛左思潮，新时代显然都还没有真正地拉开大幕。

### **为什么中国还是一个野蛮国家？**我那兄弟给长津湖配的文说：我们的平安顺遂绝对是鲜血浇筑起来的。而我心里想的却只是：我们的平安顺遂全要靠某些人死得及时。先是毛二，毛一，然后现在众望所归盼的他。

可这话光是想想就让人丧气。面对昏君暴君，你肉眼可见的毫无办法。却只能假装没有这回事，对发生在身边的奴役和不公视而不见，却偏要在十万八千里外寻找假想敌。就这还妄想输出民族文化？那是什么，掩耳盗铃欺软怕硬的贱骨头吗，还是你的科学奴役制度？

人类的文明制度只有两种：一种是把权力关进了笼子里的，一种是其他。 前一类可以称为文明社会，而中国显然是属于野蛮阵营。

好多人，自以为我们要比大清人文明先进，实际上，我们比大清人，只是多了一部手机，而大清人，也只是比我们多了一根辫子。

**中国三千年历史，政权交替只有两个动力源，一是血统继承，二是暴力创造。除此之外，至今还没有发展出第三个，即宪政契约。政治文明两千年原地踏步。中国文化也没有突破二千年前孔子界定的人际关系框架，老子界定的人文思考深度，董仲舒创造的天君人三层关系内涵。**

**[昆侖 @Kunluntalk 2023年12月23日推文]**

这点我在读《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》时感触尤其分明，因为在那之前我最喜欢的文学作品是《红楼梦》。可你看几千年下来没有长进，苏东坡时唱「一蓑烟雨任平生」，到了贾宝玉这里还是跳不出出世入世那点东西。你拿曹雪芹比比一百年后的陀斯妥耶夫斯基，思想的深度和境界不可同日而语。

文明社会以爱和自由凝聚，野蛮社会则靠仇恨和恐惧维持。而文明社会，虽然现在宗教的影响已经日渐式微，但是源起却是基督新教的精神。无论是大宪章确立起对私权的保护，还是契约政府，无不起于基督教社会。

可以这么说，目前的西方宪政民主制度，是人类唯一试验出来可以相安无事和平共处的制度体系。而其他的文明体系都是不兼容的。不管是中国的儒教文明，还是伊斯兰文明，骨子里都是先天带有种族歧视基因的，作为意识形态，所维系的只是一家一地的秩序，是无力担负起全人类文明长久和平的历史任务。如果哪天中国的民族文化当真称霸了世界，那只会让人感慨文明的陷落。

所以，从这个意义上讲，圣诞节的意义远非长津湖这种狭隘的民族主义可以碰瓷，也远超任何其他中国传统节日所能代表的思想内涵高度。
