An introduction to existential philosophy that answers all the questions that have been lingering in my mind recently.

The existential psychotherapy emphasizes a conflict that flows from the individual's confrontation with the givens of existence---certain ultimate concerns, certain intrinsic properties that are a part, and an inescapable part, of the human being's existence in the world.

Specifically, four basic issues: death, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness.

Death: We live now, but one day we will die, there is no escape. One day all my life's endeavors will come to an abrupt end, everything will be over, and my existence will be a passing smoke, and I will soon be forgotten by everyone. Realizing this, how am I supposed to live?

Freedom: The human being does not enter (and leave) a well structured universe that has an inherent design. Family, nation, society, history, freedom, justice...if people did not artificially construct and give meaning to the world, then the universe ifself would actually have no meaning and purpose, and would be nothing more than longly cold existence.

Isolation: No matter how close each of us becomes to another, there remains a final, unbridgeable gap; each of us enters existence alone and must depart from it alone. The existential conflict is thus the tension between our awareness of our absolute isolation and our wish for contact, for protection, our wish to be part of a larger whole.

Meaninglessness: The human being, a meaning-seeking creature, is thrown into a universe that has no meaning. Why are we alive? What is the meaning of life? If there is no pre-ordained design for us, then each of us must construct our own meanings in life. Yet can a meaning of one's own creation be sturdy enough to bear one's life? 

There are only two ways to deal with the brutal existential facts of life---anxious truth or denial---and either is unpalatable.  Which would you have, wise madness or foolish sanity? 

An existential therapeutic postition rejects this dilemma. Wisdom does not lead to madness, nor denial to sanity: the confrontation with the givens of existence is painful but ultimately healing. 

If a way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at the Worst.

# DeathThe biological life-death boundary is relatively precise; but, psychologically, life and death merge into one another. Death is a fact of life; a moment's reflection tells us that death is not simply the last moment of life. "Even in birth we die; the end is there from the start."

Although the physicality of death destroys man, the idea of death saves him. The idea of death may save man, and arrived at the important insight that the awareness of our personal death acts as a spur to shift us from one mode of existence to a higher one. 

Heidegger believed that there are two fundamental modes of existing in the world: (1) a state of forgetfulness of being or (2) a state of mindfulness of being.

Ordinarily one lives in the first state. Forgetfulness of being is the everyday mode of existence, in which one is unaware of one's authorship of one's life and world, in which one "flees", "falls", and is tranquilized, in which one avoids choices by being "carried along by the nobody". When however, one enters the second mode of being (mindfulness of being), one exists authentically (hence, the frequent modern use of the term "authenticity" in psychology). In this state, one becomes fully self-aware---aware of oneself as a transcendental (constituting) ego as well as an empirical (constituted) ego; one embraces one's possibilities and limits; one faces absolute freedom and nothingness.

Death is the condition that makes it possible for us to live life in an authentic fashion.

### Defenses against DeathThere are tow fundamental defenses against death: one is the pursuit of specialness, and the other is the faith of an ultimate rescuer. 

The human being either fuses or separates, embeds or emerges. He affirms his autonomy by "standing out from nature", or seeks safety by merging with another force. Either he becomes his own father or he remains the ternal son.

Overall the ultimate rescuer defense is less effective than the belief in personal specialness. Not only is it more likely to break down but it is intrinsically restrictive to the person.

It is dangerous to venture. And why? Because one may lose. Not to venture is shrewd. And yet, by not venturing, it is so dreadfully easy to lose that which it would be difficult to lose in evey the most venturesome venture,...one's self. For if I have ventured amiss---very well, then life helps my by its punishment. But if I have not ventured at all---who then helps me? And moreover, if by not venturing at all in the highest sense (and to venture in the highest sense is precisely to become conscious of oneself) I have gained all earthly advantages...and lose myself. What of that?

Kierkegaard

### Death AnxietyDeath is a primary source of anxiety.

Though we hopes to alleviate crippling levels of anxiety, we do not hope to eliminate anxiety.

Life cannot be lived nor can death be faced without anxiety. Anxiety is guide as well as enemy and can point the way to authentic existence. 

The task is to reduce anxiety to comfortable levels and then to use this existing anxiety to increase one's awareness and vitality.

It is a matter of no small importance that one be able to explain and order the events in our lives into some coherent and predictable pattern. To name something, to locate its place in a casual sequence, is to begin to experience it as under our control. No longer, then, is our internal experience or behavior frightening, alien or out of control; instead, we behave (or have a particular inner experience) because of something we can name or identify. The because offers one mastery (or a sense of mastery that phenomenologically is tantamount to mastery). I believe that the sense of potency that flows from understanding occurs even in the matter of our basic existential situation: each of us feels less futile, less helpless, and less alone, even when, ironically, what we come to understand is the fact that each of us is basically helpless and alone in the face of cosmic indifference. 

# FreedomTo the philosopher, "freedom" has broad personal, social, moral, and political implications and consequently encompasses a wide terrain. Moreover, the issue is intensely controversial: the philosophical debate concerning freedom and causality has not ceased for two thousand years. 

Throughout history free will has always managed to offend the prevailing world view. Though the controversy regarding free will has continued without cessation, the opponents of the concept have changed over the centuries. The Greek philosophers had no term for "free will"; the very concept was incompatible with the prevailing belief in eternal recurrence. The Stoic fatalists, who believed that whatever is or will be "was to be", rejected the idea of a freely willing agency in man. Christian theology could not reconcile the belief in divine providence, in an omniscient, omnipotent god, with the claims of free will. Later, free will clashed with scientific positivism, with Isaac Newton's and Pierre Laplace's belief in an explicable and predictable universe. Still later, the Hegelian idea of history as a necessary progress of the world spirit clashed with a free-will ideology that, by its very nature, rejects necessity and holds that all that was or is done could, as well, not have been done. Lastly, free will is opposed by all deterministic systems whether they be based on economic, behavioristic, or psychoanalytic principles.

The relationship between environment and personal freedom is extraordinarily complex. Do individuals carve their own destinies, or are they entirely determined by environmental contingencies.

Generally in a debate between a determinist and a libertarian (one who believed in freedom of the will) logic and reality seem to be on the side of the determinist; the libertarian is "softer" and appeals to unmeasurable, emotional argument. 

Not even the most fanatical determinist can contend that we are determined by our environment to alter our environment; such a position obviously leads to an infinite regress. If we manipulate our environment, then we are no longer environmentally determined; on the contrary, the environment is determined. 

A vast body of empirical research supports the position of reciprocal determinism. 

The phrase that creates vast problems for the libertarian is that the behavior of people immersed in water will be "remarkably similar". The issue, of course, is "behavior". How was it determined that behavior should be the criterion by which choice or freedom is measured? 

One's attitude towards one's situation is the very crux of being human, and conclusions about human nature based solely on measurable behavior are distortions of that nature. It cannot be denied that environment, genetics, or chance plays a role in one's life. The limiting circumstances are obvious: Sartre speaks of a "coefficient of adversity". All of us face natural adversities that influence our lives. But that does not mean that we have no responsibility (or choice) in the situation. We are responsible still for what we make out of our handicaps; for our attitudes toward them; for the bitterness, anger, or depression that act synergistically with the original "coefficient of adversity" to ensure that a handicap will defeat the individual. 

When all else fails, when the coefficient of adversity is formidable, still one is responsible for the attitude one adopts toward the adversity---whether to live a life of bitter regret or to find a way to transcend the handicap and to fashion a meaningful life despite it.

### ResponsibilityThe world acquiresd significance only through the way it is constituted by the human being.

The heart of Kant's revolution in philosophy was his position that it is human consciousness, the nature of the human being's mental structures, that provides the external form of reality. Space itself is not something objective and real but something subjective and ideal; it is, as it were, a schema issuing by a constant law from the nature of the mind for the coordinating of all outer sensa whatever.

The human being is not only free but is doomed to freedom. Both to constitute (to be responsible for) oneself and one's world and to be aware of one's responsibility is a deeply frightening insight. Nothing in the world has significance except by virtue of one's own creation. There are no rules, no ethical systems, no values, there is no external referent whatsoever; there is no grand design in the universe. In Sartre's view, the individual alone is the creator (this is what he means by "man is the being whose project is to be god".

To experience existence in this manner is a dizzying sensation. Nothing is as it seemed. The very ground beneath one seems to open up. Indeed, groundlessness is a commonly used term for a subjective experience of responsibility awareness. Many existential philosophers have described the anxiety of groundlessness as "ur-anxiety"---the most fundamental anxiety, an anxiety that cuts deeper even than the anxiety associated with death. 

One avoids situations (for example, making decisions, isolation, autonomous action) that, if deeply considered, would make one aware of one's fundamental groundlessness. Thus one seeks structure, authority, grand designs, magic, something that is bigger than oneself. 

To be taken in by any of these devices that allow us to flee from our freedom is to live "inauthentically" or in "bad faith". 

### WillingThe guileless expectation that an individual will change as a result of this approach stems directly from the moral philosophical belief that if one truly knows the good, one will act accordingly.

However, "will power" constitutes only the first layer, and a thin layer at that, of "willing". 

When I look back at the three or four choices in my life which have been decisive, I find that, at the time I made them, I had very little sense of the seriousness of what I was doing and only later did I discover what had seemed an unimportant brook was, in fact, a Rubicon.

W. H. Auden

The important choices that one makes in life are not consciously experienced as choices. In fact, only after the fact is one able to deduce that one has actually made a choice. This realm of will maybe thought of as a subterranean life current that has direction but not discrete objects or goals. It provides propulsion to the individual but eludes immediate and direct scrutiny.

The second realm of will is the conscious component: it is experienced during the event. The second realm of will presses toward some specific object and is utilitarian in character.

The second realm of will is approached through exhortations and appeals to will power, effort, and determination. The first realm is impervious to these enjoinders and must be approached obliquely.

Wish,  the imaginative playing with the possibility of some act or state occuring, is the first step of the process of willing. 

"Wish" gives the warmth, the content, the imagination, the child's play, the freshness, and the richness to "will". "Will" gives the self-direction, the maturity, to "wish". Without "wish", "will" loses its life-blood, it's viability, and tends to expire in self-contradiction. If you have only "will" and no "wish", you have the dried-up, Victorian, neopuritan man. If you have only "wish" and no "will", you have the driven, unfree, infantile person who, as an adult-remaining-an-infant, may become the robot man.

**Wishing requires feeling**

The wish-blocked individuals has enormous social difficulties. They have no opinions, no inclinations, no desires of their own. 

One's capacity to wish is automatically facilitated if one is helped to feel. Wishing requires feeling. If one's wishes are based on something other than feelings---for exmaple, on rational deliberation or moral imperatives---then they are no longer wishes but "shoulds" or "oughts", and one is blocked from communicating with one's real self.

**Choices and decisions**

Some peoples can proceed untroubled by proceeding blindly, believing they have traveled the main highway and that all intersections have been with byways. But to proceed with awareness and imagination is to be affected by the memory of crossroads, taking neither path because they cannot take both, cherishing the illusion that if they sit there long enough the two ways will resolve themselves into one and hence both be possible. A large part of maturity and courage is the ability to make such renunciations, and a large part of wisdom is the ability to find ways which will enable one to renounce as little as possible.

# IsolationIt is the knowledge of “my death” that makes one fully realize that no one can die with one or for one. 

The longliness of being one's own parent. To the extent that one is responsible for one's life, one is alone.

Responsibility implies authorship; to be aware of one's authorship means to foresake the belief that there is another who creates and guards one. 

Deep loneliness is inherent in tha act of self-creation, a lonely dread that is a wind blowing from one's own desert place---the nothing that is at the core of being.

### Right PathThe major buttress against the terror of existential isolation is thus relational in nature. 

Yet aloneness can be shared in such a way that love compensates for the pain of isolation. A great relationship breaches the barriers of a lofty solitude, subdues its stict law, and throws a bridge from self-being to self-being across the abyss of dread of the universe.

On the one hand, one must learn to relate to another without giving way to the desire to slip out of isolation by becoming part of that other. But one must also learn to relate to another without reducing the other to a tool, a defense against isolation. But, it is the facing of aloneness that ultimately allows one to engage another deeply and meaningfully.

If we are able to acknowledge our isolated situation in existence and to confront them with resoluteness, we will be albe to turn lovingly toward others. If, on the other hand, we are overcome with dread before the abyss of loneliness, we will not reach out toward others but instead will flail at them in order not to drown in the sea of existence. 

**Need-free love**

A relationship, at its best, involves individuals who relate to one another in a need-free fashion. 

One lets go of self-consciousness and self-awareness. One must relate with one's whole being: if part of oneself is elsewhere---for example, studying the effect that the relationship will have upon some third person---then to that extent one has failed to relate.

To care for another individual means to know and to experience the other as fully as possible. If one relates selflessly, one is free to experience all parts of the other rather than the part that serves some utilitarian purpose. One extends oneself into the other, recognizing the other as a sentient being who has also constituted a world about himself or herself. 

With one's full knowledge, gleaned from genuine listening, one endeavors to help the other become fully alive in the moment of encounter.

Mature caring is not without its rewards. One is altered, one is enriched, one is fulfilled, one's existential loneliness is attenuated. Through caring one is cared for. Yet these rewards flow from genuine caring; they do not instigate it. The rewards ensue but cannot be pursued.

### Wrong Paths**Dependency**

The human being's "universal conflict" is that one strives to be an individual, and yet being an individual requires that one endure a frightening isolation. 

Individuals whose major orientation is toward fusion are generally labeled "dependent". 

One may also shed one's isolating sense of self by fusing, not with another individual, but with a "thing"---a group, a cause, a country, a project. There is something enromously compelling in merging with a larger group. 

One knows only that one cannot be alone, that one desperately wants from others something that one is never able to obtain and that, try as one might, something always goes wrong with one's relationship. 

Yet another solution lies in the direction of sacrificing selfhood: one gains relief from isolation anxiety through immersion in some other individual, cause or pursuit. Thus, individuals are, as Kierkegaard said, twice in despair: to begin with, in a fundamental existential despair, and then further in despair because, having sacrificed self-awareness, they do not even know they are in despair.

**Sex**

Sex may be used in the service of repression of death anxiety. If we make love to a woman without relating to her spirit we are fetishists, even if in the physical act we use the proper body orifice.

One is in love with passion, one collects excitement and trophies, one warms oneself "at the blaze at the what has fallen to his lot"---but what one does not do is to relate authentically to oneself or to another.

A full caring relationship is a relationship to another, not to any extraneous figure from the past or the present. Transference, parataxic distortions, ulterior motives and goals---all must be swept away before an authentic relation with another can prevail.

# MeaninglessnessWhat is the meaning of life? Why do we live?

The human being seems to require meaning. To live without meaning, goals, values, or ideals seems to provoke considerable distress. In severe form it may laed to the decision to end one's life. Individuals facing death are able to live "better" lives, live with fullness and zest, if they are possessed of a sense of purpose. We apparently need absolutes---firm ideals to which we can aspire and guidelines by which to steer our lives.

Yet the existential concept of freedom posits that the only true absolute is that there are no absolutes. An existential position holds that the world is contingent---that is, everything that is could as well have been otherwise; that human beings constitute themselves, their world, and their situation within that world; that there exists no "meaning", no grand design in the universe, no guidelines for living other than those the individual creates. 

How does a being who needs meaning find meaning in a universe that has no meaning?

Camus stated that we are moral creatures who demand that the world supply a basis for moral judgment---that is, a meaning system in which is implicit a blue-print of values. 

Camus started from a position of nihilism---a position in which he despaired at the lack of meaning (and, thus, lack of purpose and values) in the world---and soon generated, gratuitously, a system of personal meaning---a system that encompasses several clear values and guidelines for conduct: courage, prideful rebellion, fraternal solidarity, love, secular saintliness.

Sartre arrived at a position in his fiction that clearly values the search for meaning and even suggests paths to take in that search. These include finding a "home" and comradeship in the world, action, freedom, rebellion against oppression, service to others, enlightment, self-realization, and engagement---always and above all, engagement.

### EngagementOn this one point most Western theological and atheistic existential systems agree: it is good and right to **immerse oneself in the stream of life.**

The more we explicitly search for pleasure, the more it eludes us. Pleasure is a by-product of meaning, and that one's search should be directed toward the discovery of meaning. 

Meaning, like pleasure, must be pursued obliquely. The more we rationally seek it, the less we find it; the questions that one can pose about meaning will always outlast the answers. A sense of meaningfulness is a by-product of engagement. 

The solution to the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of the problem. 

Engagement is the therapeutic answer to meaninglessness regardless of the latter's source. Wholehearted engagement in any of the infinite array of life's activities not only disarms the galactic view but enhances the possibility to one's completing the patterning of the events of one's life in some coherent fashion.

To find a home, to care about other individuals, about ideas or projects, to search, to create, to build---these, and all other forms of engagement, are twice rewarding: they are intrinsically enriching, and they alleviate the dysphoria that stems from being bombarded with the unassembled brute data of existence.

一本存在主义哲学的导读，解答了所有最近在我脑子里盘桓不去的问题。

存在主义讲的是那些终极关怀，那些人之所以为人的必然特质。具体而言，四大基本问题：死亡、自由、孤独和无意义。

**死亡**： 我们现在活着，但是总有一天会死，无可逃脱。总有一天我一生的努力都将戛然而止，万事皆休，我的存在将是过烟云烟，很快就会被所有人忘记。意识到这些，那我该怎么活下去？

**自由**： 人类并不是进入一个拥有内在设计、高度结构化的宇宙。什么家族传承、国家民族、社会历史、自由正义，如果不是人们强行构造、人为地给世界赋予意义，那这宇宙的本身其实毫无意义和目的，不过是些孤零零的冰冷存在罢了。自由意味着我们所站立的地方并不坚实，什么都没有，是无底的深渊，无尽的虚无。既然一切都没有根基，那我该选择相信和坚持什么？

**孤独**：无论人和人之间变得多么亲密无间，仍然存在一个无法逾越的鸿沟。我们每个人都是独自一人来到世上，也注定将独自离开，与其他生命隔绝，与世界隔绝。但另一方面我们又渴望接触和保护，渴望成为一个更大整体的一分子。这两方面到底要怎么调合？

**无意义**: 人类这种寻找意义的生物，却被投入到自身毫无意义的宇宙之中。我们为什么活着？生命有什么意义？如果没有什么预先设计的蓝图，那么我们每个人就必须构建自己的生命意义。然而，一个人自己创造出来的意义能否坚强到令其能容忍生活？

要处理这些生命中无情的存在事实，要么焦虑，要么否认。那到底是要做疯狂的智者，还是健全的蠢货？存在主义拒绝这种两难，教我们怎么鱼和熊掌都要。智慧并不会导致疯狂，否认也不会使人健全。

# 一、死亡### 1. 死亡的意义你认为死亡只发生在生命的最后一天吗？不是的。

生物学意义上的生死界限相对精确，然而在心理上，生命和死亡相互交织。它们同时存在，而不是先后发生。死亡在生命的表层之下持续骚动，并对经验和行为产生巨大影响。

尽管肉体的死亡会毁掉人，但死亡的观念却能拯救人。死亡的意识起到一种鞭策的作用，促使我们从一种存在模式转移到更高级的模式。

海德格尔认为，世上有两种基本的存在模式：1. 忘失的存在状态(forgetfulness); 

2. 念兹在兹的存在状态(mindfulness). 人通常活在第一种状态中，意识不到是他创造了自己的生活和自己的世界，倾向于逃避、沉沦和麻木，通过随波逐流来回避选择。然而，当人进入第二种存在模式，人就能真诚地存在，能够包容自己的可能性与局限，能够面对绝对的自由与虚无。

而死亡是使我们有可能以真诚的方式来生活的处境。

### 2. 对抗死亡的模式对抗死亡有两种基本防御模式，一种是寻求独特性，一种是寻求终极拯救者。

人与人之间或是融合或是分离，或是互相嵌入或是特立独行。人们或者通过出类拔萃来证实自己的自主性，或是通过附着于其他力量来寻求安全感。人们要么变成自己的父亲，要么永远作为儿子。

总的来说，终极拯救者的应对方式不如个人独特性的信念有效。不仅因为它更容易破灭，而且也因为它所固有的对人的限制性。

……冒险是危险的。为什么呢？因为可能会有损失。不去冒险是明智的。可是不去冒险非常容易丧失即使在最危险的冒险中也很难丧失的东西……就是他自己。如果我的冒险出了差错，那么生命会用它的惩罚来帮助我。可是如果我完全不去冒险的话，那谁来帮我呢？再说，以最高意义讲，即使通过完全不去冒险(以最高意义来讲，正是冒险使人意识到自己)我就算获得了一切凡世的利益……却丧失自己。那有什么意义？

---克尔凯郭尔 《焦虑的概念》

### 3. 死亡焦虑死亡是焦虑的根本来源。我们虽然希望减轻焦虑的破坏性后果，但却不希望消除焦虑。没有焦虑，就不能活出真正的生活，也无法面对死亡。焦虑既是敌人，也是向导，它可以指出真正的存在之路。

我们的任务是把焦虑减轻到比较舒适的程度。

人是否能够以一些条理分明且可预期的模式来解释、梳理生活中的事情，这可不是一个无足轻重的问题。我们把某件事情置于因果关系之中，它就好像处于我们控制之下了。那么，我们的内在体验或行为就不再恐惧、排斥或担心失去控制；相应地，我们的行为(或内在体验)也以我们能命名或识别的东西为依据。这种“因为”给人以掌控感(或者说在现象学上相当于掌控的掌控感)。我相信这种从理解所涌现的能力感，也同样发生于我们的基本存在处境方面：每个人都在面对宇宙的冷漠，每个人本质上都是无助而孤独的，当我们开始了解到这样事实时，出乎意料的是，我们反而感觉到更少的无价值感、更少的无助和更少的孤单。

# 二、自由### 自由意志的有无对于哲学家来说，自由具有广阔的个体、社会、道德和政治含义。关于自由和因果的哲学论战两千多年来从未止歇。

事实上，在整个历史中，自由意志一直是违背主流世界观的。古希腊哲学家没有自由意志的说法：这个概念和当时永恒循环的主流信念不相容。斯多葛学派的宿命论者相信一切都是过去已有的，拒绝接受人类拥有自由意志的观点。基督教神学无法将自由意志的主张与他们信奉的全知全能上帝的旨意相融合。自由意志与科学实证主义相冲突，与可解释、可断言的宇宙相抵触。黑格尔的历史观认为世界的本质是必然进步的，但自由意志的本质拒绝必然性。所有基于决定论思想体系的学科，无论是经济学、行为主义还是精神分析，都反对自由意志。

那么人是否塑造自身命运呢？还是人的命运完全由环境的种种情况决定？

外在环境和个人自由之间的关系极其复杂。

一般来说，在决定论者和自由意志论者之间的辩论，逻辑和现实似乎站在决定论者那一边。自由意志论者比较软弱，在论证中偏好诉诸不可测量的情感。但是反过来讲，绝对的环境决定论也讲不通：既然我们都是由环境决定的，而每个人都可以借由操纵环境来操纵行为。这就自相矛盾了：到底是谁在操纵环境呢？

大量的实证研究支持交互决定论的立场。

对自由意志者造成最大困扰的是所谓落入深水中的人们的行为会非常相似。但问题是，在衡量自由时，为什么要以行为做标准呢？

一个人面对自身处境的态度才是人之所以为人的关键，仅仅是基于可测量的行为来判断人性，是对人性的扭曲。我们无法否认环境、遗传和偶然事件在人的一生中占有一定分量。环境的限制作用是很明显的。我们每个人都会面临影响生活的外在困境。但是这并不能说明我们在这个情境中就毫无责任了。我们对自己从困境中能获得什么负有责任，我们面对困境的态度负有责任，对自己是否会被伴随而来的痛苦、愤怒、沮丧所击倒负有责任，即便所有的努力都失败了，逆境无法克服，人们也要为自己对逆境采取的态度负责：是痛苦懊恼地生活，还是找到超越逆境的方法，在逆境中重建有意义的生活。

### 责任只有通过人构建世界的方式，世界才获得了意义。

康德对哲学的革命核心是他认为人的意识、人的思维结构和性质为真实提供了外在形态。空间本身不是客观和真实的，而是主观和理想化的，其现在如是，过去亦如是，是由思想本质中自带的恒定规律所产生的框架，用来协调所有外在的感觉。

萨特说，人类不仅仅是自由的，而且注定是自由的。个体构建了自己和自己的世界，也因此为此负责。如果不是个人的创造，世上万物都没有意义。宇宙不存在规则、道德系统、价值、任何外在的参照物和宏大的计划。在萨特看来，个体本身是创造者，这就是他说“人就是要成为上帝的存在”的含义。

用这种方式体验存在是令人头晕目眩的。任何事都不是它过去看起来的那个样子了，这就像人脚下的地面突然裂开了一样。实际上，无根感常常被用来描述觉察到责任时的主观体验。许多存在主义哲学家将无根感带来的焦虑视为最根本的焦虑，它要比死亡焦虑切入得更深。

对于那些深入思考便会让自己意识到根本性的无根感的情境，例如作决定、孤独、自主的活动，个体避之唯恐不及。因此人们追求秩序、权威、宏大的图景、魔术等，即那些比自己大的东西。

任何这些使人们逃避自由的手段，都是不真诚地或是怀有坏信念地生活。

### 意志人们有一种来源于道德哲学的期望很天真，认为如果一个人知道什么是好的，他就一定会依此而行动。但意志力仅仅构成了意愿的第一个层次，而且是薄薄的一层。

“当我回顾一生中三四次具有决定性的选择时，我发现，我做出选择的时候，几乎没有感觉到它们的严重性，只是事后才发现看似微不足道的小溪，实际上是鲁比肯河。”

人在一生中做出的重要选择，并不能在意识层面清晰地体验到。事实上，只是在事后追溯才能推断自己其实做出了选择。这类意志可以看作是生命的潜流，虽有方向，却不是明确的实体或目标，它提供推进的力量，却巧妙地避开了直接、即刻的观察。

第二类意志则是意识的成分：在事件发生之时就有所体验。第二类意志竭力趋近某些特定的对象，功利性是其特质。

第二类意志可以通过劝告和诉诸意志力、努力、决心来处理。第一类意志则不受这些命令的影响，必须以间接的方式来对待。

愿望，在想象中体验产生某种行为或状态的可能性，这是意志过程的第一步。

愿望为意志提供了温暖、内容、想象力、兴味、新鲜度和丰富度。意志使愿望得到自主和成熟。没有愿望，意志就失去了其赖以为生的生命之血，在自我矛盾中走向死亡。如果只有意志而没有愿望，人就是干瘪的，像维多利亚时代的新清教徒。如果只有愿望而没有意志，人就是被动、不自由、幼稚的，就像长大的婴儿，或是像机器人。

**愿望需要感受**

愿望受限的人有很严重的社交困难。他们没有意见，没有喜好，没有自己的愿望。如果我们帮助一个人去感受，他的愿望的能力就会自动得到促进。愿望需要感受。如果一个人的愿望基于感受之外的东西，例如理性思考或道德责任，那么，它们就不再是愿望，而是必须或应该，人与真实自我的交流就被封锁了。

**选择和决定**

有些人可以无忧无虑地盲目前行，相信自己走在康庄大道上，所有岔路都是偏僻小径。但是带着觉察和想象力前行的人，由于想到自己不可能再遇到这些岔路，就会受到触动。有些人因为无法两条路都走而停下来，在十字路口坐下，幻想自己如果坐得够久，两条路就会自动变成一条路，使两条路都走成为可能。很大程度上，成熟和勇气是能够做出这样的放弃，很大程度上，智慧能够找到使自己尽可能不停下来的方法。

# 三、孤独意识到自己的死亡会让人彻底了解没有人可以与别人一起死亡，也没有人可以替代另一个人死亡。一个人为自己的生命负责，这是很寂寞的——做自己父母的孤独，意识到自己是自己生命的作者意味着不再相信有人可以创造和保护自己。自我创造的行为本身蕴涵着深刻的孤独感，那是一种从自己内心的荒凉中生起的恐惧，因为存在的核心是虚无。

### 对抗孤独的正道用以对抗存在孤独的主要力量就是关系。

孤独感可以被共享，爱能够弥补孤独感带来的痛苦。伟大的关系可以突破孤独的障碍，压制它的严厉规则，在不同个体的自我之间架起一座桥梁，跨越对世界的恐惧深渊。

在与他人建立关系时，人一方面不能为了逃避孤独而使自己成为他人的一部分，另一方面也不能为了对抗孤独把他人当成自己的工具。但是，正是因为面对孤独才能让一个人和另一个人深刻地、有意义地彼此关联。

如果我们承认自己的存在是孤独的，并且毅然地面对孤独，我们就能够真正地去爱他人。可如果我们在深不可测的寂寞前为恐惧所征服，我们就不能够真正和他人建立联系。

**无所求的爱**

最好的关系是个体以彼此无所求的方式建立关联。

放下自我意识和自我觉察，以自己整个存在与对方建立关系，如果自己有一部分在别处，就可以说关系已经失败。尽可能彻底地了解对方，体验对方的世界。如果一个人能够无私地和对方建立关联，就能自由地体验对方世界的各个部分，而不是某个符合功利目的的部分，把自己拓展到对方的世界，认识到对方是另一个有感情的存在，对方有着自己的世界。通过真实的倾听得以全面了解另一个人，努力帮助对方在和自己建立关联时刻充满生机。

成熟的爱并不是没有回报。人会改变，变得更丰富，感到自我被实现，存在孤独也得以减轻。通过爱人，自己也得到了关爱。但是这些回报只源自真正的爱。这些回报是自然产生的，而无法求得。

### 对抗孤独的弯路**依赖**

人类的普世冲突是人想成为独立的个体，可成为个体又需要忍受可怕的孤独。当个体主要的生存取向是融合时，通常被称为依赖。

人也可能借着与某物融合，比如某个团体、使命、国家、项目，摆脱孤独的自我感。与集体的融合中，有着深深吸引个体的因素。

人能意识到的是自己无法忍受孤独，拼命地要从他人那里获得某种自己永远无法获得的东西，结果，无论自己如何努力，在关系中好像总有什么地方出了错。

还有另一种解决方式是牺牲自我，借着让自己投入于某个人、某个目标或者追求，缓和孤独带来的焦虑。在这种情况下，人因为牺牲了自我意识，甚至不知道自己的绝望，这才是更深的绝望。

**性**

性可以用于抑制死亡焦虑。如果我们和一个女人做爱，却没有与她的灵魂建立联系的话，我们就是恋物癖，即使在性交过程中我们使用了正确的部位。人爱上激情，收集刺激和战利品，用落入自己生活的火焰温暖自己，却不以真诚的方式在自我和他人之间建立关系。

一个真正的、关爱的关系是和另一个人的关系，而不是任何来自过去或者现在的这段关系之外的人的关系。移情、隐藏的动机和目标，都需要被铲除，才能让真诚的关系得到建立。

# 四、无意义生命的意义是什么？我们为什么而活着？

人追求意义。没有意义、目标、价值的生活会带来巨大的痛苦。在严重的情况下，可能会导致人做出结束生命的决定。面对死亡的个体，如果他们具有意义感，那么他们就能够生活得更好，更充实和有激情。显然，我们需要某种绝对性，需要可以让我们去努力追求，指导我们生活方面的实实在在的理想。

但自由告诉我们，唯一的绝对就是没有绝对。世界是偶然的，任何事情都可能是另一副样子。人构成了自身、自己的世界以及在这个世界中自身所处的情境。不存在意义。在宇宙中没有宏大的设计，没有指导生活的原则，除非个体自己创造这些原则。

需要意义的个体如何在一个没有意义的世界中找到意义？

加缪说我们是道德的生灵，我们要求世界提供一个道德评判的基础，也就是一个具有价值蓝图的意义系统。

加缪起始的立场是虚无主义（因为世界缺少意义、目的和价值而绝望），然后很快发展出一个个人意义系统，这个系统包含几个突出的价值和行为准则：勇气、高傲的反抗、齐心协力、爱以及尘世的圣洁。

曾说出“人是一种徒劳无益的激情”以及“我们的诞生毫无意义，死亡同样没有任何意义”的萨特，也在他的小说明确肯定了对意义的追寻。他甚至提出追寻的道路，包括找到一个家，在这个世界上与他人共同的归属感、自由、反抗压迫、为他人服务、启蒙、自我实现以及参与。

这其中最重要的是参与。

**参与(Eagagement)**

人完全浸入生命之流中是既美好又正确的。体验到深刻意义的人生活得更为充实，面对死亡时比缺少意义的人更少绝望。

人越是寻求快乐，越是越不到快乐，这是享乐主义者的悖论。快乐是自然产生的，无法追求而得。快乐并不是最终的目的，而是个人追求目的的副产品。意义，也像快乐一样，不能直接求得。我们越是理性地寻求意义，我们就越不可能发现意义。人对意义的疑问总是要多于人对意义问题的答案。意义感是参与生活的副产品。

说到人生问题的解决之道，就是让这个问题消失。不管是什么带来了无意义感，治疗的答案就是参与。全身心地参与生活不仅可以消除宇宙观点带来的无意义感，还可以提高个体以某种和谐的方式完成生活的可能性。

组建家庭，照顾他人，构思和参与项目，去发现、创造、建设，所有这些以及所有其他形式的参与都能够带来双重回报：它们能够丰富个体，并且可以缓解由存在的残酷现实直接造成的强烈不安。
