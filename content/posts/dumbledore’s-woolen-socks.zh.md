Every now and then I think of Dumbledore’s woolen socks.

When Harry asked Dumbledore what he saw in the Mirror of Erised, Dumbledore said he saw himself holding a thick pair of woolen socks.

“One can never have enough socks. Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.” — *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone*

Of course, Dumbledore wasn’t really short of socks. For a great wizard, conjuring socks is hardly a problem. Woolen socks stood for family affection.

Just as Dumbledore wanted socks but kept receiving books, I too often have small, genuine needs that go unnoticed or suppressed.

My WeChat profile picture hasn’t changed for six years. I’m not the kind of person who likes taking photos. In the past I was always too reserved, often transparent in group activities. I’d look through all the photos of an event and not find a single one with me in it. So when someone finally managed to take a good picture of me, I kept using it until it wore out. And the person who took that photo happened to be a girl who liked me. Which made me wonder: is it only someone who loves you that can take a good photo of someone who never looks good on camera? After all, who else would bother to focus on you, to find the right angle, and even refine the photo afterward?

But this led me to think further: If I clearly have needs, why I am always too ashamed to voice them?

Maybe because I’ve experienced too many moments where saying it made no difference. Over time I developed this passive emotional mode:

- If you don’t say it, but others can still guess and meet the need—that’s a huge bonus, affection skyrockets.

- If you express it just lightly, and the other person goes to great lengths to meet your subtle need—that’s another bonus.

- If you say it and others ignore it or dismiss it—even after you emphasize it repeatedly—that’s a deduction.

- Worst of all, like my father: you tell him, and he mocks you for it.

But this way of thinking is too twisted.

When we were younger, maybe it wasn’t so hard for others to understand. But as we grow in mind and experience, to still expect unspoken understanding is basically waiting for a miracle.

A more mature way is to express your needs bravely and honestly. This not only takes care of your own feelings, but also gives others the chance to understand you.

Back then, I was ashamed to speak up because I misunderstand human relationships. I thought it was a zero-sum game: if others had to go out of their way to meet my needs, it meant I was somehow taking advantage.

But that’s not true.

Existential isolation is a condition every human must face. And the main force that counteracts it is relationship.

Relationships can break through the walls of isolation, building bridges between different selves.

In fulfilling our own needs, we are also giving others the chance to practice loving.

Through encountering another person, we are changed. Our inner world grows richer. Even a brief encounter can become an internal reference.

Just like the Sword of Gryffindor absorbs whatever makes it stronger.

If you doubt it, just look at how many of your habits—picked up unconsciously—might trace back to someone’s example or a stray word in your past.

This is also why, when friends ask me whether they should have children, I usually encourage them to.

It’s not that children need parents—it’s the opposite: parents need children.

Children offers parents the chance to experience need-free love, directed toward another human being.

And it is precisely this process that helps parents fight and dissolve existential isolation.

So, my friend, do you also want a pair of woolen socks?

每每想起邓布利多的羊毛袜。

哈利问邓布利多在魔镜里看见什么时，邓布利多说，他看见自己拿着一双厚厚的羊毛袜。

“袜子永远不够穿。圣诞节来了又去，而我始终没有得到过一双短袜。人们老是送书给我。”——《哈利·波特与魔法石》

邓校当然不是真缺袜子，大魔法师想要袜子还不是想要多少就能变多少。羊毛袜代表亲情。

就像邓布利多想要袜子却总收到书，我也常常有一些细小而真切的需要，却常常被忽略、被压抑。

微信头像已经六年没换了。

我平时是个不爱拍照的人。

过去总是过于拘谨，在集体活动中常常隐身透明。

老是翻遍集体活动照片找不到一张自己的。

所以难得有人能给我拍一张好照片，就一直用到废。

刚好拍这张照片的是一个喜欢你的女生。

让我更是不禁疑问：**是不是有爱的人才能给不上相的人拍出一张好照片？**

毕竟谁没事儿有那闲功夫特意来拍你，外加还要找好角度、后期修图。

而又让我多想一层的是，**我明明有需要，可为什么总是羞于启齿？**

可能经历过太多说了也没用的瞬间，所以就养成了这种总是被动等待的情感模式：

- 如果不说，别人也能够猜到并加以满足，就有巨大的加分，好感爆涨。

- 其次是你只浅浅地表达以后，别人却能大费周章地来满足你的细微需要。

- 减分的是你说了别人也无动于衷和忽略，甚至再三强调TA也不当一回事。

- 最恶劣的是我老爹那种，你跟他说了以后他还反过来嘲讽你。

但这还是太过拧巴了。

以前年轻时别人理解你可能还没那么大难度。但现在随着心智和阅历渐长，再奢求不言而喻的理解，简直就是在等待奇迹。

**更加成熟的做法就是勇敢坦诚地表达需要，既是在照顾自己的情感，也是在给别人理解我们的机会。**

以前羞于启齿，可能也是因为那时我们错会了人和人之间的关系，误以为这是一种此消彼长的零和游戏——让人费心费力去满足我们的需要，好像就是某种形式上的损人利己。

但这不是真的。

存在性的孤独是每一个人都要面对的处境，而用以对抗存在性孤独的主要力量就是关系。

关系能突破孤独的障碍，在不同个体的自我之间架起桥梁。
我们在满足自己需要的同时，也在给予别人练习爱人的机会。

人通过与另一个人的相会而被改变，内心世界会变得更加丰富。
即使只是短暂的相会，它也会成为人内在的参考点。

正如格兰芬多宝剑会吸收那些让它变得更强大的东西。

不信你就可以看看自己身上有多少不经意的习惯，或许就是来自于过往生命中某个人的行为示范抑或只言片语。

这也是如果有朋友来咨询我要不要生孩子，我一般都劝生的理由。

孩子并不需要父母，而恰恰相反，**是父母需要孩子。**

孩子给了父母一个机会，一个对象，去实践无所求的爱。

而正是这个过程，帮助那些身为父母的人对抗和消解了存在性的孤独。

所以，我的朋友，你也想要一双羊毛袜吗？
