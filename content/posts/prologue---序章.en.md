On the occasion of turning 29, I'm opening this space for writing.

## Why create this space?### Birthday CommemorationI have a strong desire to celebrate my own birthday.
Perhaps it's because 29 is a prime number, which aligns with my aesthetic sense of numbers.
There are also forgotten promises, a sense of ritual, and other reasons.
I'm jotting down my thoughts at this moment to commemorate it in the future.

### The Measure of TimeThe denominator of memory has grown so large that while new ideas and experiences increase, their proportion diminishes, and the threshold continues to rise.
Time distorts and accelerates in subjective perception. We need something to balance out this confusion.
Calendars are too thin; some people use film, landmarks, food, stamp collections (sleeping around)... I use words and thoughts.

### Soul-searchingThe heart gathers dust and needs to be questioned from time to time. An unexamined life is not worth living.
I open this small pond, to wash away the dust and for personal reflection, letting anyone participate freely.

## What do I want to achieve?### Literary VersionMay it cleanse away the filth and allow clarity of heart,
transcend simple repetition and distinguish chaos from disorder,
give time its vitality and the soul its depth.

### Plainspoken VersionFuck the flowery language above.

This is just a place to freely vent and curse, to write whatever I want.

Who am I? I am an independent and free thinker. I disregard all the rules imposed by the outside world—laws, morals, ethics, social norms, common sense—none of them concern me. Are laws and rules made for people like us?

When writing in other places, there's always too much noise in my head, constantly considering how others might perceive it.
I can't freely express rebellious, shocking, or pretentious thoughts. It's suffocating.

## What will I write about?### TopicsStocks, history, current affairs, film reviews, the way of the world, human nature, data, code, food, relationships... Whatever, have fun!

New ideas, novel toys, or simply tossing out a question to be answered later. Anywhere the brain can be used, anything that can be played with.

### PrinciplesBig or small, nothing is off-limits—go ahead and do as you please.
No promotions, no buying followers, no need to impress anyone. Enjoy yourself!

**Note**: The public account is named "Zheng Shiqi," meaning a regular 17-sided polygon, inspired by *Hero Legends*.
It symbolizes the idea of "squaring the circle," where a perfect circle belongs to the divine realm, and humans can only turn circles into squares, inching toward that perfection. The plan is to master 17 fields of study.

值此二十九岁之际，开下这个写字的地方。

**一、为啥开这么个地方**

**1. 生日纪念**

执念地想为自己过一个生日。

大概29是个素数，符合自己对于数字的美感。还有遗落的约定，仪式感及其他。

提笔记录下此时的心境，以为他日的纪念。

**2. 时光刻度**

记忆的分母已大到一个程度，新思想新体验在增长比例日减的同时 ，还不断刷高门槛。

时间在主观感受上扭曲加速。我们需要某种东西来平抑这种错乱。

日历太单薄，有人用胶片、地标、美食、集邮册……我们用文字，用思想。

**3. 灵魂拷问**

心会蒙尘，需要时时拷问。「未经思考的人生不值得过」。

开这半亩方塘，濯缨濯足，任君自为。

**二、想要达到什么效果**

**1. 文艺版**

愿它荡涤污浊，明心见性；

超越简单重复，区分混乱无序；

给时光以生命，予灵魂以厚度。

**2. 人话版**

Fuck上面那一段。

就是找一个可以自由宣泄、自由骂人的地方，想写什么就写什么。

我们是谁？我们是独立自由的思想者。无视一切外界加诸的规则，什么法律道德伦理，什么人情世故常识……关我P事。「礼法岂为我辈所设哉」

别的地方写东西时脑子里噪声太多，总要顾虑他人观感。离经叛道、惊世骇俗、矫情装X的话不能畅所欲言，真是闷死我了。

**三、想要写些什么东西**

**1. 领域**

股票、历史、时政、影评、世道、人心、数据、代码、饮食、男女……Whatever, have fun!

新鲜的思想，新奇的玩具，或者就只是抛出一个不解答的问题留待日后。

一切脑子可以派上用场的地方，一切可以玩出花样的玩意儿。

**2. 原则**

事无大小，百无禁忌，随意胡来。

不推广，不刷粉，不取悦人。

玩得开心！
