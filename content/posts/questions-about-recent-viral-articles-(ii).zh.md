## **I. On How to Properly Rebut Arguments**I read Lu Kewen’s “The Hong Kong Issue and the Truth About the World” again. Boiled down, it’s two parts: the first half claims Hong Kong hides behind democracy and freedom to demonize the mainland; the second half uses historical anecdotes to show the dangers of freedom and democracy.

I’ve read a lot of rebuttals. Many attack the factual accuracy of the historical examples he cites. I think that misses the point. Fact-checking history is just data cleaning. To refute someone’s model, you need a better model. Even if the author invented his history wholesale, readers would still get his argument.

No matter how much you tout democracy and freedom, the dangers of fragmentation and chaos are real. Without a concrete, workable solution for maintaining national unity and order, and for settling the messy aftermath of redistributing interests, you won’t convince anyone.

## **II. The Problem with “The Truth About the World”**Lu Kewen’s model is simple and easy to grasp. Its only flaw is that it’s wrong.

But it’s also very hard to falsify. Because reality isn’t as simple as 0 and 1, black and white.

What we’re actually facing is more like a hundred-point exam—an advanced calculus exam.

You don’t just pick an ideology and have national prosperity fall from the sky.

Democracy and authoritarianism aren’t natural opposites. In fact, you can sense the optimal solution probably lies somewhere between them.

Finding that point—and more importantly, designing an algorithm (a system of institutions) that makes getting close to that point the norm—how the hell is that a multiple-choice question?

And when you add in all the other goals—national security, economy, technology, culture, education, public health, environment—can you even do the math?

The computing power this requires means mobilizing society’s whole energy and intelligence.

## **III. The Party Leads Everything? Does It Have What It Takes?**So when the Party shouts slogans like “The Party leads everything,” it must be opposed. Because the Party doesn’t have that capability.

I used to believe that if the Party broadly absorbed representatives from all social classes, internal Party democracy radiating outward could be a form of democracy. That most members were good people—that despite some blemishes, the core was sound.

I don’t believe that anymore.

Only the key people in critical positions actually count—they outweigh millions of Party members. All those good people are just tools, utterly worthless when facing real power.

This form of power structure is actually a waste of society’s intellectual resources.

For example:

When they were beating war drums a year ago as Trump threatened tariffs, did they grasp the massive power gap between the two countries? Could they have foreseen today’s outcome—tariffs imposed, concessions made?

When they petulantly refused to import American pork and turned to Russia instead, importing diseased pigs, what were the health and quarantine officials doing? Did they anticipate today’s result—no pork to eat?

Nothing stands up to scrutiny. One line from the top leader—”I’ll take full responsibility”—overrides all expert opinion.

So if the Party continues to strengthen its control over everything, that’s absolutely not good news for society as a whole.

In my view, the optimal form of organization is probably some version of weak central government + regional autonomy. Central and local governments would have clear power boundaries. For instance: national defense and foreign affairs go to the center; economy and people’s welfare stay local. Different regions vary wildly in development levels and even ideologies. Top-down unified control by the central government actually exceeds what the government can handle.

## **IV. Distributed Organization**No matter how disappointed you are with democracy, you can’t deny the rationality and necessity of the idea and system of separation of powers.

Increasingly complex social problems are far beyond what any single-core processor can handle. What we actually need is to plug more high-capacity, intelligent nodes into distributed cloud computing through some efficient organizational structure. What should happen is deeper decentralization—mobilizing society’s collective energy and brainpower to handle multiple tasks in parallel.

I mentioned in my last piece that the Party-state is working hard to atomize citizens. In practice, this means breaking up spontaneously organized clusters of people, scattering them, and plugging them all into one central mega-processor.

Sure, this architecture is simple and easy to manage, but it obviously stifles the full potential of our resources.

The glaring problem now is that this central processor clearly lacks the computing power it imagines—the kind that would make “governing a large country like cooking a small fish.”

All the tasks that could run in parallel are now queued up, bottlenecked by the central processor’s capacity.

We could be doing so much more.

## **V. Where Is the Cure for Civilization?**I agree with Jeff Yang’s comment from the last piece: “Western values are not the cure for civilization.”

First, because values are only a small part of national development. Second, because the cure for civilization hasn’t appeared yet.

**From a practical perspective:**

National development is an incredibly complex function. Influencing factors include geopolitics, population (size/quality/structure/character), institutional policies, competitors, and more.

Values are just a small part of it.

For instance, what stopped the German war machine wasn’t Britain’s democratic system—it was the English Channel. Otherwise Churchill wouldn’t have made it to America’s Lend-Lease Act. Stalin might not have beaten Hitler if Hitler had been able to focus on him.

China’s economic miracle, honestly, was mainly about getting in with the US and joining the global trade system, right? Without that, our economy would have grown, but nowhere near as fast.

I haven’t studied Taiwan’s development in depth, but I get the sense that geopolitics played a huge role there too.

Too many factors influence a nation’s fate more than values or ideology.

One key factor is whether the country can select talented, capable people to govern.

When I look at America, I can’t help but marvel. Those who think America will decline quickly must be blind.

When people can reject slick political elites like the lie-spewing Hillary Clinton and pick a pragmatic politician with sharp vision like Trump; when the rest of the world has no answer to automation displacing workers, America produces rising stars like Andrew Yang who think about the future.

It makes you wonder: is the political IQ of the populace part of national strength?

Look back at China: dragging its feet on political reform, even marching backward; slow to respond to population problems, wealth inequality, and all sorts of real issues; clueless about the visible future of automation... this kind of social organization can’t handle what’s coming or adapt to change.

Back to Hong Kong: while many mainlanders only see conflict, chaos, and violence, I see the power of civil society. Hong Kong has more organic vitality than the vast majority of mainland cities. Its civic responsibility, shared values, awareness, and organizational capacity far surpass mainland society. Sure, Weibo and WeChat claim 1.4 billion flag-wavers, but mobilizing and organizing as effectively as Hong Kong is no easy feat.

I don’t want to say much more about Hong Kong.

On right and wrong, I’ll just say one thing (told this to Brother Qiang three months ago): when I saw ordinary Hong Kong residents spontaneously shielding protesters from police, I knew immediately which side justice was on.

Isn’t this the most common story in movies and novels? If you still don’t get it, put yourself in the villain’s shoes and see how it feels.

**From a spiritual perspective:**

In *The Next 100 Years*, Friedman says our era will be seen as a dark period in human history. I think he’s right.

The old values date back hundreds of years, and the new era hasn’t shown its dawn. We may be born and die in this long night.

But let’s keep searching—we’ll just be fertilizer for the new age.

**一、 杂谈如何正确反驳**

又把卢克文的香港问题和世界真相看了一遍。提炼一下，大体两部分：前半部分讲香港如何以民主自由自居，妖魔化大陆；后半部分拿历史故事讲自由民主的危害。
我看了很多人的反驳文，不少立足于作者所用史实的真实性。这个我觉得其实没有抓到重点。考证历史不过是数据清洗。要否定别人的模型就要拿出比他们更牛逼的模型。作者即使使用虚构的历史，也不妨碍人们读懂他的意思。

再怎么鼓吹民主自由。分裂和混乱的危险也是真实存在的。没有切实可行维持国家统一和秩序、摆平各种善后利益分配问题的解决方案是难以说服人的。

**二、 世界真相文的问题**

卢克文的模型简单易懂，唯一的毛病是不对。
但是你也很难去证伪他。因为事情远不是0和1，黑和白那么简单的问题。
事实上摆前眼前的更像一张百分卷。还是高等数学那一类的。

并不是你简单地选一下意识形态，民富国强就从天而降。
民主和集权并不天然对立。事实上你能感觉最优解应该存在于二者之间的某个点上。
而如何找到这个点，以及更进而地如何设计一套算法(制度)让接近于这个点成为常态，这特么哪是选择题？
更进而的加入国家安全、经济、科技、文化、教育、卫生、环保等诸多目标后，算得过来吗？
这个需要的算力是需要动员起社会的积极性和聪明才智。

**三、 党领导一切？配吗**

所以，当党喊出“党领导一切”这种口号时，必须地反对。因为党没有这种能力。
当我十年前申请入党时我相信党员大部分是好人，虽有污点但主体是好的。如果党广泛吸纳社会各个阶层的代表，那么由党内民主而外的形式未尝不是民主的一种。
十年后我不得不说 I'm fucked. 
关键位置的重要人物才算数，权重远超千万党员。万千好人也不过都是一个个工具人，在权力面前P用不顶。
这种形式的权力架构实则是对社会智力资源的浪费。
举例来说：
当他们一年多前在川总刚要加关税时喊打喊杀，可清楚两国之间巨大的实力差距，可能预见到今天税照加地照割的结果？
当他们赌气不去进口美国猪肉转而从俄罗斯进口瘟猪时，卫生防疫部门的官员在干什么，有没有预见到今天没有猪肉吃的结果？
事情经不起追问。最高领导一句“一切责任我负”就可以打破一切专家意见。

所以党如果要继续加强权力领导一切，那么对于社会整体绝不是什么好事。
在我的认知里，我隐约觉得最优的组织方式应是某种形式的弱势中央政府+地区自治的模式。中央政府和地方政府有清晰的权力边界。比如国防外交归中央，经济民生归地方。各个地区的发展程度甚至意识形态都大不相同，由中央政府自上而下的统一管控其实超出了当前政府的能力边界。

**四、 分布式组织**

再怎么对民主失望也不能否定分权思想制度的合理性和必要性。
日益繁杂的社会问题远不是单核的处理器能够应付的。实际上需要的是把更多高能力的聪明头脑节点以某种高效的组织方式广泛接入分布式的云计算资源当中。应该做的是更充分的放权，调动起社会整体的积极性和脑力资源，并发式地处理多元任务。
我上篇提到党国目前致力于国民原子化的努力，实则是把国民一个个自发组织的集群拆散打乱，统一接入到一个中央超级巨型处理器上。
这种架构当然简单清晰好管，但是显然地抑制了资源潜力的充分发挥。
现在最明显突出的问题就是这个中央处理器显然没有他想象中的“治大国如烹小鲜”的强大计算能力。
所有本可以并行处理的任务，受制于中央处理器的运算能力而排队拥堵。
我们本来可以做得更多。

**五、 文明解药在哪里**？

我赞同Jeff Yang上篇的评论“西方价值观不是文明解药”。
一是因为价值观对国家发展只是很小的一部分；二是因为文明解药还没有出现。

**从现实来讲，**

国家发展是个太复杂的函数。影响因素包括地缘政治、人口(数量/素质/结构/性格)、制度政策、竞争对手等等。
价值观仅仅是其中的一小部分。
就比如挡住德国战车的并不是英国的民主制度，其实就是英吉利海峡。否则丘吉尔撑不到美国的租借法案。斯大林也未必能赢过腾出手来的希特勒。
中国的经济奇迹，平心而论，大头的原因不就是和美国搭上关系从而被纳入了世界贸易体系吗？没有这个，我们的经济一样会发展，但是绝对不会有过去那么快。
台湾发展我没有深入研究过，但隐约觉得这其中也和地缘政治干系很大。

有太多因素比价值观/意识形态更能影响国家命运。
其中的关键因素之一就是是不是能选贤任能地来治理国家。
我看向美国时忍不住赞叹。那些认为美国会很快衰落的人怕不是瞎了。
当民众能从满嘴假话的希拉里之流政治精英里，选出川普这样具有敏锐眼光而务实的政治家；当世界其他地方还对自动化取代人工毫无反应时，美国就出现了杨安泽这样着眼未来的新星。
有时让人不免生疑：民众的政治智商是不是也是国家实力的一部分？
反观中国现实，对政治改革的裹足不前甚而是大步后退，对人口问题、贫富差距等种种现实问题的反应迟缓，对自动化这种可见未来的茫然无措…这样的社会组织方式是不足以面向未来应对变局的。

回说香港问题，当很多大陆人只看到香港的冲突混乱暴力。我看到了公民社会蕴含的力量。香港社会是比绝大部分大陆城市更有内生力量的社会组织形态。其公民责任、价值认同、思想觉悟、组织协调，远强于大陆社会。虽然微博微信动辙14亿护旗手，但想要如香港社会这样有效地组织动员起来并非易事。

香港问题我不想多说了。
关于是非对错我就只讲一点(三个月前我和强哥讲过)：当我看见普通香港居民自发掩护抗议者对抗警察时，我天然地就相信正义在哪方。
这不就是影视小说里最常见的桥段吗？再不理解你就把自己带入反派角色体会一下。

**从精神来讲，**

未来一百年里弗里德曼说我们现在的时代是人类历史上的一段黑暗时期。我感觉他讲的应该是对的。
旧的价值已经是几百年前的产物，而新的时代还没有露出曙光。我们可能生死都在长夜里。
且上下求索，就当为新时代贡献肥料好了。
