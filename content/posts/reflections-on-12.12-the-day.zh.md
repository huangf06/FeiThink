I watched *12.12: The Day* (Seoul Spring) the day before yesterday. I’m not a professional film critic, so I’ll just share my impressions.

Three years ago, on Professor Ti’s recommendation, I had already seen *The Fifth Republic*[^1], so the historical events of South Korea’s December 12 coup were not unfamiliar to me. What actually bothered me was the film’s use of altered character names—I couldn’t keep track of who was who, which added to my viewing difficulty. I don’t understand why, when political dramas can be made with real names, they suddenly become taboo when they hit the big screen.

To heighten dramatic tension, the film forcibly manufactures some rather implausible plot points, making the coup seem absurdly casual. The coup had already begun, yet it still required General Jeon[^2] to personally rush around督战 supervising the frontlines and putting out fires everywhere. In this regard, I feel *The Fifth Republic*, unhindered by time constraints, was more logical. The members of Hanahoe were utterly determined to seize power for their own interests, and each key figure displayed considerable initiative during the coup. One scene that left a particularly deep impression on me was when Kim Jin-young (in reality, from the coup faction) single-handedly stopped anti-coup tanks—a kind of reverse “Tank Man” if you will. *Seoul Spring* basically portrays an organized and premeditated military coup by regular forces against a government side that lacked mental preparation, had weak resistance, and fought scattered battles.

In the end, those patriotic soldiers on the side of justice in the coup didn’t fare too well, while the coup’s leaders—Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo—each served as president in turn. Although later tried and convicted, they only spent a few years in prison before being pardoned by Kim Dae-jung. Both lived until 2021, dying in their hospital beds at ninety.

Many people say they felt heavy-hearted after watching this film, which is only natural—who can bear to see those who turn back the wheel of history riding high? Yet upon closer reflection, one must acknowledge the harsh reality of political struggle and the tortuous path of historical progress. The Seoul Spring events occurred after South Korean President Park Chung-hee was assassinated, but before that, he had been a dictator for eighteen years. During those eighteen years of dictatorship, South Korea experienced rapid economic development, known as the “Miracle on the Han River.” Economic development lent legitimacy to the authoritarian government—so much so that more than thirty years later, Koreans still missed Park Chung-hee, using their votes to push his daughter, Park Geun-hye, into the presidency. The film doesn’t provide much background on Hanahoe, but it was actually an organization of loyalists personally cultivated by Park Chung-hee. After Chun Doo-hwan came to power, he essentially continued Park Chung-hee’s pro-American, anti-communist, and economic liberalization policies. His achievements in economics and diplomacy were noteworthy—South Korea experienced the world’s fastest economic growth at the time, with national income quadrupling, and successfully hosted the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

At this point, I wonder if you’re reminded of another major figure in China during the same period? Similar rise to power through a coup[^3], similar political repression of pro-democracy movements, similar economic liberalization. That’s right—Deng Xiaoping. But what’s worth pondering is that while both men did essentially the same things, their posthumous reputations are worlds apart. In South Korea, almost no one defends Chun Doo-hwan; some say that among all Korean presidents, Chun scores zero in achievements and ten in wrongdoings. But look at his Chinese counterpart, Deng Xiaoping—many Chinese people still regard him as the greatest politician of the twentieth century. How do you explain this? It comes down to being elevated by comparison. When you compare him to his Chinese counterparts, he does indeed appear taller and more imposing.

Another point of comparison: after the Gwangju incident, the tide of democratization in South Korea did not cease. Eventually, pro-democracy figures Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung came to power, and South Korea’s democratic politics got on track. By contrast, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, China’s democracy movement was crushed and never recovered. The Charter 08 later counted as another attempt by the elite class, but it lacked widespread popular support. To this day, most Chinese people are too frightened to discuss politics. No matter how much the authorities act against the grain, most people treat it as the elephant in the room, as an unchangeable fait accompli. All their solutions just work around it, making improvements. They completely ignore that it is the root of the problem and must be the first thing to be solved. Because the most important mark of democratic politics is the rotation of political parties, it must step down to prove that power can be transferred peacefully. Otherwise, no matter how much you talk, it’s futile—just another cycle of “hide our strength and bide our time—the state advances while the private sector retreats.”

Of course, if you say that this kind of cycle is still better than what happened fourteen times in ancient China—those dynastic transitions where the population plummeted by seventy percent—that’s also true. But damn it, that’s too depressing. Don’t Chinese people deserve civilization? Look at South Korea and Taiwan—after thirty years, their democratic politics are already quite impressive. But look at China—it remains a barbaric society, both domestically and internationally. Their minds are full of “either you kill me or I kill you” thinking, with no understanding of responsibility, no idea how to coexist peacefully and equally with others.

It’s clear that China’s century-long journey has been nothing but detours. Fukuzawa Yukichi wrote *An Outline of a Theory of Civilization* in 1874, and one hundred fifty years later it still resonates powerfully across time:

The external forms of civilization are easy to adopt, but its spirit is difficult to grasp. To adopt European civilization, one must begin with what is difficult and proceed to what is easy—first transform people’s hearts, then reform government ordinances, and finally achieve tangible material results. Following this sequence, though difficult, presents no real obstacles and can smoothly reach the goal. If the order is reversed, it may seem easier, but in reality the path is blocked, like standing before a wall unable to move forward an inch—either hesitating and making no progress, or trying to advance an inch only to retreat a foot.

This is probably also why South Korea’s democratic process, despite setbacks, ultimately succeeded. In Park Chung-hee’s South Korea and Chiang Kai-shek’s Taiwan, though dictatorial, they were still only authoritarian. Society still had legal political opposition, independent media, a degree of freedom of speech, and processes like local grassroots elections continued to exist. The seeds of freedom and democracy gradually took root in people’s hearts. Even when suppressed, democracy movements could continue to grow, ultimately forcing the democratization of the nation’s highest power elections.

By contrast, Communist China lacks such free space. The values of freedom and democracy circulate only among the elite, while at the societal level there is no space for corresponding democratic forces to grow—almost all space for social autonomy is suppressed. Under such totalitarianism, how can you talk about transforming people’s hearts, about the spirit of civilization?

So some say that South Korea’s democratic transition holds no lessons for China. China’s democratization can only draw from other totalitarian societies, and currently there are only two models: the Soviet-Eastern European transformation and the Germany-Japan model. But the former involved internal evolution under containment by the free world, and by today’s standards can hardly be called successful—it still can’t contain a dictator like Putin, who is leading Russia toward a second collapse. That leaves only the Germany-Japan model.

And indeed, we can see it is step by step following Germany and Japan’s path, becoming a de facto Axis leader and the munitions factory of the totalitarian world. We can only hope it achieves success in one stroke and smoothly gets on the right track, rather than the worse outcome—getting beaten without even tasting the meat. But who could occupy China and forcibly implant a constitutional democratic system? So the most likely outcome is still getting beaten like Germany and Japan, then walking Russia’s half-baked path.

So after watching *12.12: The Day*, who can help but think of Tiananmen? Who can help but sigh with regret at how that one failed moment brought such vastly different fates to the nation and people in the decades that followed? Though I know this is wishful thinking, with no basis in political reality—like hoping Emperor Kangxi would lead an industrial revolution—but the possibility did exist, after all.

As for whether these dispirited subjects who’ve lost their courage still deserve saving—I have no answer. Since your bottom line is firmly in someone else’s grasp, your opponent’s optimal strategy is naturally to test just above your bottom line, and the current state is still far from that bottom. Since you’ve chosen a wretched life over a dignified death, then live wretchedly for now. When you can’t stand it anymore, then figure something out.

[^1]: *The Fifth Republic* ranks among my personal top three political dramas, full of famous scenes and memorable lines, even spawning a field of study called “Fifth Studies.” Five-star recommendation.

[^2]: Because in *The Fifth Republic*, there was a prop error where the production team left off a stroke in the Chinese characters for “Major General” (少将) on Chun Doo-hwan’s nameplate, writing it as “Little General” (小将), thus giving Chun this nickname.

[^3]: In case it needs explaining: overthrowing the Gang of Four was a coup, and sidelining Hua Guofeng to force his resignation was also a coup.

前天看了《首尔之春》，不是专业电影评论员，就聊聊自己观感。

三年前因为提老师的推荐已经先看过《第五共和国》[1](#footnote-1)，所以对于韩国双十二政变的历史事件倒不陌生。反倒是电影里边的各种人名改编看得我难受，各种对不上号，增加了我的观影难度。不理解政治剧都能用真名拍出来了，上了影院反倒要避讳。

电影为了增加戏剧冲突，强行制造一些不怎么合理的情节，把政变拍得如此儿戏。政变都已经开始了，居然还需要全小将[2](#footnote-2)到处大刀督战四处救火。这方面感觉还是《五共》不受限于时长，情节上更合理一些，一心会的人上上下下铁了心的为了一己私利要夺权，各骨干人物在政变中发挥了相当的主观能动性，尤其让我印象颇深的是现实里发动政变一方的金振永孤身一人拦住了反政变部队的坦克，可以说是逆向的坦克人了。首尔之春基本是场有组织有预谋的正规军政变集团对抗一帮没有思想准备、抵抗意志薄弱、各自为战的政府军。

最后那些在政变中正义一方的爱国军人们下场也不怎么好，反倒是政变核心全斗焕、卢泰愚各自先后做了总统，后来虽被审判也没坐几年牢就被金大中赦免，都一直活到2021年，90高龄死在病床上。

不少人看了这部电影说心情沉重，自是人之常情，谁忍见逆潮流而动开历史倒车的人春风得意。可细细想来却也不能不承认政治斗争的现实和历史进程的曲折。首尔之春发生在韩国总统朴正熙被刺杀之后，而在那之前他已经独裁了18年。在他独裁的18年里正是韩国经济高速发展的时期，史称“汉江奇迹”。经济的发展给威权政府增加了合法性，甚至于三十多年后韩国人还在怀念朴正熙，用选票把她女儿朴瑾惠推上总统的宝座。关于一心会这个组织电影里没有多做背景介绍，它实际上是朴正熙一手提拔的向他个人效忠的心腹组织。而全斗焕上台以后基本上延续了朴正熙的亲美反共和经济自由化政策，在经济外交上的成绩可圈可点，彼时韩国世界第一高速经济发展，国民收入比之前翻了两番，还成功举办了1988年的首尔奥运会。

说到这里，不知道你有没有联想到同时期中国的另一位大人物？同样的政变上台[3](#footnote-3)，同样的政治上高压镇压民主化运动，经济上自由化。没错，邓小平。但很值得细思玩味的是，两人干的事其实都差不多，但身后地位何其之悬殊。在韩国基本上没人为全斗焕辩护，有人说历代的韩国总统评价中，全斗焕是功零过十。但反观他中国的同行邓小平，至今不少中国人仍把他视为20世纪最伟大的政治家。关于这你要怎么解释，只能说全靠同行衬托了，拿他和他中国的同行们一比，那他又确实高大伟岸起来了。

另一个可供对比的是，光州事件之后韩国民主化的浪潮并未停息，直到后来民主派的金泳三金大中上台，韩国的民主政治步入正轨。而作为对比，自那年春夏之交，中国的民主化运动则一战而亡一蹶不振，也就只有后来的零八宪章算是精英阶层的另一次尝试，但再无民间的广泛支持。直到今天中国人还是吓破了胆避谈政治，不管上面再怎么倒行逆施，大多人还是把它当成房间里的大象，当成无可改变的既成事实，所有的办法都只是绕着它改良。全然不顾它就是问题的根本，必须要第一个被解决。因为民主政治最重要的标志就是政党轮替，所以它必须下台以证明政权能和平交接，否则再怎么说破天都是徒劳，徒然又是一些“韬光养晦-国进民退”的轮回。

当然你要说这种轮回，相比古代先后发生过14次的那种人口锐减七成的改朝换代轮回还是强点的话，那也是事实。但是这特么也太泄气了，中国人就不配文明点吗？看看韩国、台湾，三十年下来民主政治已经蔚为可观。而反观中国，至今仍是一个野蛮的社会，不管是国内还是国际上，脑子里全是你干死我我干死你这种思想，全不知责任为何物，不懂如何与人平等地和平共处。

可见中国百年之路尽是迂回。福泽谕吉在1874年写就的《文明论概略》，一百五十年过去了仍然穿越时代掷地有声：

	文明的外形易取而精神难求。汲取欧洲文明，必须先其难者而后其易者，首先变革人心，然后改革政令，最后达到有形的物质。按照这个顺序做，虽然有困难，但是没有真正的障碍，可以顺利达到目的。倘若次序颠倒，看来似乎容易，实际上此路不通，恰如立于墙壁之前寸步难移，不是踌躇不前，就是想前进一寸，反而后退一尺。

这大概也是韩国民主进程虽有曲折但仍然最终成功的原因吧。韩国朴正熙和台湾蒋介石时代，虽然独裁但终归还只是威权，社会上还有合法的政治反对派，有独立的媒体有一定的言论自由，地方基层选举这种过程仍然存在，自由民主的价值种子逐渐地深入人心，民主化运动即使遭到镇压仍然能生生不息，最终迫使国家最高的权力选举实现民主化。

而反观共产中国，则不具备这样的自由空间，自由民主的价值只在精英分子里面流传，而社会层面缺少相应的民主力量滋生空间，几乎一切社会自治空间都被打压。这样的极权之下，谈何变革人心，谈何文明精神。

所以有人说，韩国的民主化转型对中国没有借鉴意义，中国的民主化只能在同为极权社会的地方找借鉴，目前就两种：苏东演变和德日模式。但前者是在自由世界围堵下内部演变，现在看来也算不得成功，仍然关不住普京这种独裁者，带领俄国走向二次崩溃。而剩下的选项目前就只有德日模式了。

眼见着他也确实在一步步走着德日的路，俨然成了轴心国领袖和极权世界兵工厂。现在只能希望它能一战功成顺利走上正轨，而不是更差的结果---肉没吃上打白挨了。但是谁又能把中国占了，强行给他植入一套宪政民主体系。所以结果大概率还是挨德日的打，完了再走苏俄的半吊子路。

所以看了《首尔之春》，谁能不想起三十多年前的那一晚，谁能不扼腕叹息呢，叹息当年的一步之差，在几十年后给国家民族的命运所带来的截然不同的影响。虽然知道这是一厢情愿，毫无现实政治根基，就好比希望康熙开国引领工业革命一般，但谁让这可能性毕竟存在过呢。

而至于失去勇气的贱民们还配不配拯救，我是没答案的。你的底线既然被人死死拿捏，那你的对手盘最优策略自然是在你的底线上方试探，而现在这种程度还远远没到底呢。既然选择好死不如赖活着，那就先赖活着吧。什么时候忍不了了，再想办法。

[1](#footnote-anchor-1)《第五共和国》这部剧可算得上政治剧里个人排名前三了，各种名场面名台词，由此还生出一门“五学”。五星推荐。

[2](#footnote-anchor-2)因为在《第五共和国》里面有一处剧组道具错误，把全斗焕职务牌上的汉字“少将”少写了一撇写成了“小将”，所以全斗焕得了这么个外号。

[3](#footnote-anchor-3)不知道需不需要解释，打倒四人帮是政变，架空华国锋逼其下台也是政变。
