## **Robert’s Rules of Order**When I was running a reading group on *The Federalist Papers*, we ran into some problems. This led me to rethink how we might organize discussions—a format that would let people with different viewpoints sit down together and tackle controversial topics in an orderly fashion.

I spent some time studying Robert’s Rules of Order, and my intuition told me this was an excellent toolkit with remarkably broad applicability. People kept insisting that Robert’s Rules only works in parliamentary settings, for discussing actionable business. But I think they’re wrong. What parliamentary procedure really tackles is this: “How do we reach consensus and maintain order through equal self-governance, without any central authority?” The way I see it, this applies to almost any discussion with three or more people. Those who claim it only works in very limited contexts are like people who tell me “MBTI only belongs in HR”—they’ve missed the deeper principles at work.

In essence, Robert’s Rules is an art of defining the boundaries between the collective and the individual.

## **Reflections on *****Twelve Angry Men***Once I understood the basic principles, the question became: how do you actually put this into practice? I have to say, there’s precious little to go on. Partly this reflects the failures of our education—no one ever teaches you how to organize and work with others as equals in a self-governing way. But it’s also the cultural conditioning of everyday life: rigid hierarchies everywhere you turn. People are conditioned to be led, to wait passively for instructions, or else to become lone wolves who’d rather go it alone than waste breath on collaboration.

So yesterday I pulled out *Twelve Angry Men* and rewatched it through the lens of what I’d just learned about Robert’s Rules. A few new things struck me:

**First**, everywhere—East or West, doesn’t matter—you’ve got rule-breakers, people full of prejudice and emotion. It’s neither realistic nor necessary to expect that a few rules will keep everyone in line.

**Second**, some rules are worth adopting—like when it’s someone else’s turn to speak, everyone else keeps quiet; stick to the issues, no personal attacks. Even these seemingly obvious rules weren’t perfectly followed in the film, but it didn’t matter. What matters most, the core principle, is that the minority gets to speak. As long as minority voices can be heard, reason has a fighting chance.

**Third**, groups can be wise. Look, even Henry Fonda’s character started with nothing more than reasonable doubt—no hard evidence. But as the debate unfolded, others chimed in with their own knowledge: how switchblades work, what eyeglass marks look like. Gradually a fuller picture emerged. Sure, you could call it mob mentality—at the beginning only the protagonist voted not guilty while everyone else piled on. But once real communication started, the group ended up seeing a more complete picture than any single person had at the outset. That’s what collective wisdom looks like to me.

## **Appendix: Eight Principles from Robert’s Rules**Finally, here are my own distilled “Eight Principles from Robert’s Rules”—a selection I’ve reorganized and plan to test-drive in the reading group.

**I. During free discussion:**

- **Decorum in debate**: No personal attacks, moral judgments, or questioning of motives. Address the measure, not the member.

- **No interruption**: Members cannot interrupt a speaker who has been recognized, except for urgent parliamentary matters

**II. When debate is needed:**

- **Germaneness**: Stay on topic, remarks must be relevant to the question

- **Alternating debate**: The chair should alternate between speakers for and against the motion

- **Clear position**: State your stance first (support or oppose), then provide reasons

**III. When debate gets heated:**

- **Limits of debate**: Standard rule is two speeches per member, ten minutes each (modifiable by motion)

- **Address the chair**: All remarks addressed to the chair, no cross-debate between members

**IV. When voting is needed:**

- **Majority vote**: A motion passes when more vote in favor than against; ties fail. Motions that suspend rules or limit member rights require a two-thirds vote

**Note:** Why do I want to run a reading group anyway? Isn’t it better to just research and think deeply on your own?

For one thing, it helps with loneliness. Loneliness is a chronic disease. At one point I felt myself sliding toward depression, and the reading group genuinely helped pull me back. Plus, good conversation—really good conversation—is its own kind of joy. Probably only people who’ve experienced it know what I mean.

For another, there’s my longstanding obsession with collective wisdom. I recently came across an intriguing question on Weibo: Why is *The Crowd* (Le Bon) a bestseller while *The Wisdom of Crowds* is practically unknown? You can’t just chalk it up to “everyone thinks everyone else is a mob”—because often enough, reality bears that out. But whether you get mob behavior or collective wisdom depends entirely on how the group is structured. Same carbon atoms can form graphite or diamond; it all comes down to molecular arrangement.

Individual rationality and wisdom have their limits. But if we pursue collective wisdom seriously, we might reach places individual minds simply cannot go.

## 罗伯特议事规则之前做《联邦党人文集》读书会时，遇到一些问题。
于是想要重新构想一种组织形式，可以让不同观点的人坐在一起有序地讨论一些争议性的话题。

研究了一段罗伯特议事规则，直觉上这是一套很好的工具，适用范围极广。
反复有人跟我说，罗规只适用于议会这样的场合，讨论那些可以执行的事务。
但我以为不然，议事规则研究的是“如果在没有权威的情况下，平等自治，达成共识，重建秩序”的问题。
那按我的理解，几乎可以适用于所有三人以上的讨论。
说只适用极有限场合的，就好像那些跟我说“MBTI理论只适用于人力资源领域”的人一样，没有充分理解其中的精神原理。

实质上，罗规是一门关于“群己权界”的艺术。

## 《十二怒汉》观后感理解了大致原理，接下来琢磨的是如何实践的问题。
不得不说，可供参考的素材太少。
这一方面是学校通识教育的缺失，没人教过你如何和人平等自治地组织协作；
另一方面是社会文化的耳濡目染，日常生活里到处是森严的等级体系，大家更习惯的是“被领导”和“伸手党”，以及与其和别人多费唇舌还不如自己单打独斗的“独行侠”。

昨天我又把《十二怒汉》翻出来，结合新学的罗规重看了一遍。
看完有以下几点新的感触：
1. 不管哪儿，无论东方还是西方，到处都有不守规矩的，都有充满偏见/情绪的人，指望立几个规矩就能约束各色人等，不现实也没有必要。

2. 有些规矩很有借鉴意义，比如，轮到别人发言的时候其他人就闭嘴，就事论事不准人身攻击…
就连这些听上去理所当然的规矩，其实电影里也不是遵守得很好。但是不妨碍。
最重要、最核心的点是保证少数派能说话。
只要少数方能说话，就有能以理服人的机会。

3. 群体是有智慧的。
就连亨利·方达的角色一开始也只是一个合理怀疑，没有充分根据。但是辩论起来以后，其他人就不断补充出各自了解的信息，比如蝴蝶刀的用法、眼镜印痕…，最后就形成了一个更全面的图景。
如果强要说乌合之众也可以说得通，毕竟一开始只有主角一个人跳反，其他人都是一窝蜂地认为有罪。但是一旦有效交流起来以后，最后大家就都看到了一个，相比任何一个单人刚开始看到的，更全面的信息图景。
这就是我眼里看到的群体智慧。

## 附：罗规八条最后附上我自己拣选重排编的“罗规八条”，准备在读书会上小试牛刀。

一、自由讨论的时候，

- 文明表达原则：不得人身攻击、道德审判、质疑动机

- 发言完整原则：不得打断别人发言

二、需要辩论的时候，

- 一时一件原则：不得跑题

- 正反轮流原则

- 立场明确原则：先表明赞成反对，再陈述理由

三、辩论激烈的时候，

- 限时限次原则：每人2次发言，每人2分钟

- 面对主持原则：面对主持发言，不能直接辩论

四、需要表决的时候，

- 过半通过原则：赞成多于反对动议通过，平票不过。
特殊议题（涉及少数权利）过三分之二通过

**说明：**
我为什么想要搞读书会？自己孤独研究深度思考不好吗？

一方面确是排遣孤独的需要。孤独是种慢性病。
我感觉自己曾一度濒临抑郁，读书会确实有效地缓解了。
而且高级的聊天是种享受。大概只有经历过的人才明白。

另一方面，则是自己心心念念的“群体智慧”。
最近在微博上看到个有意思的问题：
为什么《乌合之众》会大热，而《群众的智慧》几乎无人问津？
倒也不能全怪“大家都认为别人是乌合之众”。因为现实如此。
而结果是通向“乌合之众”还是“群体智慧”，关窍全在于其中的组织结构。
正如一样的碳原子，究竟是组成石墨还是组成金刚石，全在于分子结构。

个体的理性和智慧终究有限，而顺着群体智慧的方向研究，则有可能达到一种个体智慧无法企及的“奇境”。
