In my previous article on motivation systems, I mentioned something I want to do. Now let me indulge in the wildest fantasies and count the things we want to do. This is purely whistling in the dark to bolster our courage.

## **First, I Want to Be a Great Mind**First of all, I want to be a great mind. I still don’t know how to translate this properly: great thinker? Great philosopher? Great prophet? Whatever... If I could only choose one thing from everything I want, this is what I would keep no matter what.

I spent a long time resenting my dark college years and the ups and downs of my career. And now I’m proud of that. Today I take pride in my experiences. Perhaps I hadn’t realized before: I never wasted my years. My interests and focus were always different from others. We never stopped on the path of understanding the world and pursuing truth. My terrible college performance was because I spent enormous energy restructuring my understanding of the world. Four years and four hundred borrowed books isn’t exactly wasting time. My winding career path came from refusing to become an oversized screw while understanding the world. We should be the ones designing machines, not machine parts. Yes, that’s how badass it is.

If the pursuit of happiness means abandoning my mind, then I’ll choose suffering. I often scorn evolutionary psychology—it seems to explain everything. But it can’t explain why awkward beings like me exist. Is it because for me, this is a higher source of pleasure? Stop. We won’t dig any deeper. Who cares. Like a drowning person—when there’s a straw, grab it tight. Don’t ask. Whether it’s spiritual light or carnal indulgence, we extract vitality from every possible source, to feel alive. Otherwise we’ll drown.

I’ve found that this shift in thinking brings me all sorts of inexplicable courage to face things head-on. The logic behind my wild and presumptuous behavior is this: if I can’t enjoy myself now, what good is this iron staff? Even if there are many tomorrows ahead, what pleasure would they hold? Might as well enjoy each day and count it as profit.

In previous articles and social media posts, I’ve repeatedly mentioned that my ideal is to pursue another PhD in humanities. My current level is still too amateur; I need more professional training. But the fact is, I still have no clue about this, no action plan. Because I don’t know what discipline my intended field of study actually falls under. So let’s eliminate them one by one. History? Though I love history, I have zero interest in textual research. In my view, historical research is just data cleaning—what interests me more is modeling, fortune-telling, prophecy: building models based on the big data of what actually happened in history to make predictions about the future. Other purely speculative humanities disciplines? Doesn’t seem like it either. What I want to study is some kind of interdisciplinary work combining arts and sciences, containing both qualitative and quantitative content. I scoff at disciplines that claim to explain everything. It must be able to make predictions. Economics? Perhaps closer, but the scope of my intended research isn’t limited to economic activity—it includes social politics, and even the spiritual realm. I haven’t yet found a specific discipline that fits. I vaguely sense that useful content includes philosophy, sociology, geopolitics, demography, economics, and so on. I need to continue researching this.

## **Second, I Want to Run for Congress**One impression from my Hegel philosophy class: those great philosophers all harbored political ideals, didn’t they? Though they talked about the universe, existence and spirit, all sorts of things—to my ears it all sounded like politics, social ethics, relationships between people, relationships between people and the world. From the court above to the common people below, everyone dreams of some ideal world, without exception. Whether it’s professors devoted to scholarship at Fudan, or internet fiction authors like Maoni.

I hope the people of the Qing Kingdom can all become unrestrained people. When abused by others, have an unyielding heart; when struck by disaster and evil, have an undefeated heart; when there is injustice, have a fearless heart to correct it; do not fawn before jackals and tigers.

Maoni, *Joy of Life*

This is a sentence that made a strong impression on me after watching a few episodes of *Joy of Life* at Qiang’s place. This is the author’s political ambition. So what does my ideal state look like? Right now I only have a vague outline, still many confusions and uncertainties. I will continue exploring in some form.

When chatting with Qiang about the old days, he completely forgot that when we started college he said he was a literary youth who wanted to become a master like Ji Xianlin. We didn’t continue the conversation. I’m not sure if anyone remembers what I said back then. But I still remember. I said I wanted to become a statesman. When this word comes up, I don’t know what image floats into people’s minds. What I’m thinking of now are people like Franklin, Hamilton, Jefferson. Of course this is quite different from what I understood when I first said those words.

**Why can’t I just do my job well and leave specialized matters to specialists?**

The truth is, everywhere I look I see all kinds of idiots. So much so that mindless statements run rampant in the world, nonsense becomes viral articles, yet even properly trained professionals can’t produce a single decent rebuttal. Come to think of it, all the talented people went into natural sciences and engineering, leaving a bunch of untalented monkeys and spineless literati to sway people’s thoughts and determine national policies and futures. Pathetic.

How can we hand the world over to idiots and scoundrels?

**Why can’t I, as some nationalists suggest, take the civil service exam and enter government if I’m dissatisfied with the country?**

- The power structure determines that no matter how much tiny progress there is at the grassroots level, it can’t stop those at the top from flipping the table and starting over. Things need fundamental solutions. First solve the framework problem, then fill in the details.

- Civil service cultivates more administrative officials, bureaucrats, clerks. They don’t have the freedom to advocate their own political positions.

- In reality I’ve met quite a few pragmatic types who worked their way up from the grassroots. Their thinking has been locked into that discourse system—even one more word with them makes me annoyed. I certainly won’t add another counterexample myself.

So, I’ll choose another way. First, what we need to do is research at the cognitive level, understand the true spirit and principles. Then study application-level matters, see what can actually be done.

Of course, achieving this goal depends on many external factors—can’t assert it’s definitely achievable. Let’s tentatively set twenty years as the timeframe. Ten years to learn lessons, ten years to build strength.

## **Third, I Want to Continue Researching Financial Markets**
- Financial markets are our window for obtaining information. All political and economic developments are reflected first in financial markets.

- Financial markets are our touchstone for verifying whether our understanding is correct. If you really have such a brilliant mind, with such close-to-reality cognition of the world that you can make predictions, then prove it to us! As I’ve written in previous articles, adults have no educational value. Getting idiots to admit they’re idiots is impossible. So let’s make a bet. Taking money from idiots is the proper way to educate them.

- I think it might be an important means of ensuring financial independence in the future. I strenuously avoid using the term “financial freedom.” Because in my view, those whose mouths are always full of “financial freedom” are boring people with little independent thinking ability. For many people, financial freedom is quite a vague concept approaching infinity. When Mark and I coincidentally both asked “why pursue financial freedom,” someone mentioned optionality. In fact, I don’t think this is a convincing viewpoint either. Optionality isn’t without cost—in reality you’re trading your time for it. I’ve seen too many people who don’t know at all what they want, yet desperately chase optionality. If I clearly know what I want and don’t want, why would I waste extra time and energy pursuing unnecessary options?

**Why can’t I, as Liang suggests, devote myself fully to stock investing?**

Stock investing gives people more motivation to study the world’s broad interconnections, to research current affairs and industry trends more, rather than limiting their gaze to their own little patch of land. But I’ve also seen quite a few full-time stock traders whose understanding is closed off, insufficient for grasping the whole picture. Lacking deep participation in social division of labor makes people prone to explaining everything with closed logical systems. This doesn’t align with our fundamental goals. In other words, financial investing is merely a byproduct of our process of understanding the world.

## **Fourth, I Need a Real Job with Deep Participation in Social Division of Labor**Regarding work, my feelings are truly complicated right now—seriously dragging my feet, not a bit of motivation to work. If there’s really nothing particularly suited to me, I’d honestly rather trade stocks alone to support the family. A brilliant leader and a seamlessly cooperative team are truly rare finds. In ten years there have been only a few months when I encountered one or half of such people. Not that others have nothing worthwhile—leaders are leaders because they naturally have their unique qualities. It’s just that we have independent evaluation standards. Borrowing a line from our school song: character and insight come first, arts and letters follow.

Just now lying in bed I thought of many reasons why I still need a real job, which rekindled a bit of motivation. First, I need to max out my data science skill points. This tool-like thing—before I have a clear research plan—still needs further mastery and proficient application. It’ll be useful in the future. Second, I’ve always wanted to research the hive mind. But I always feel my current capability is insufficient to handle it. Continuing to accumulate experience in social participation and collaborative division of labor is very necessary—many cognitive and skill-level things still need polishing. For the first goal, first-hand practical experience is direct material. I always worry about becoming an out-of-touch idiot. For the second goal, it’s the need to maintain keen perception and combat skills. If the eventual conclusion is confrontation, then we must be more cunning and more ruthless than the treacherous and evil. We scam the scammers. Of course, the work format isn’t limited—whether enterprise, NGO, association, or political party—but maintaining deep social participation is necessary.

## **Fifth, I Still Need a Generator/Discriminator/Enhancer**In plain language: I need a woman and a group of companions. I need some people to trigger inspiration, some people to help prune overly divergent ideas, and some people to coincidentally validate viewpoints we’re not so certain about.

One major reason I’ve delayed settling down is that I can’t easily give my important things to others. When you make someone an important part of your life, you’re handing them the discriminator—such power over life and death, giving them some ability to reward good and punish evil. This is momentous—not something to entrust lightly to anyone not equal in values and intellect. Moreover, if you spend too long with people of lower intelligence or mediocrity, there’s the risk of reinforcing stupidity and mediocrity. I’ve witnessed this firsthand—can’t be too careful. Regarding views on choosing partners and friends, my current thinking isn’t mature enough. And it’s very related to the hive mind problem I want to research. I’ll discuss this issue in detail later.

These are the five things I currently want to do. There are many other small matters and experiential goals—I’ll mention these smaller goals when I have the chance. This is the main framework.

*Explanation: Let me finally explain why I must speak out my thoughts. Because traditionally we’re always taught to hide our goals in our hearts, work hard step by step, do great things quietly. Those who speak out their ideas are often called people without ambition who keep making resolutions, or there’s that “the nail that sticks out gets hammered” or “the tallest tree catches the wind” nonsense. In fact, that used to be my creed and operating style too. But I intuitively feel such dogma is too stale, doesn’t fit the modern spirit. So I choose not.*

*Three considerations:*

- *Implement our principle of thinking aloud.*

- *Train my ability to focus. Simply put, if speaking out makes you feel tremendous pressure, you’re giving others too much attention they don’t deserve. Making a fortune quietly isn’t exciting at all, doesn’t show capability. Getting things done under everyone’s watchful eyes—that’s real skill.*

- *Attract kindred spirits.*

上篇动力系统的文里提到了一件我想做的事。
现在不妨最狂妄地畅想一番，数数我们想做的事。
纯属走夜路吹口哨为自己壮胆。

### **第一，I want to be a great mind.**First of all, I want to be a great mind.
我还是不知道怎么翻译：大思想家？大哲学家？大先知？whatever…
如果所有想要的东西里只能选一样，那我无论如何想要保留这一项。

我曾长期因自己大学的黑暗时光和职业生涯的坎坷波折而颇多怨艾。
And now I'm proud of that. 而今我以我的经历而感自豪。
可能我之前也没有意识到，我何曾荒废岁月。我的兴趣和着眼点本就异于他人。我们在认识世界追求真知的路上未曾停歇啊。
我大学的渣是因为我把很大的精力花在重新结构化认识世界上。四年四百本书的借阅记录并不算得过分虚度。
我的职业路弯是因为我在认识世界的过程中拒绝把自己变为大号螺丝。我们应该是设计机器的人而非机器的一个零部件。没错，就是这么牛逼。

如果pursuit of happiness追寻快乐幸福的代价是放弃脑子，then I'll choose suffering 那我会选择痛苦。
我常鄙夷进化心理学，好像可以解释一切。但我就不能解释为什么会有我这样别扭的存在。是因为对我来说，这是一种更高的快乐源泉？
打住。我们不再继续深究。管他娘的。好比快要淹死的人，有根稻草就赶紧牢牢抓住。别问。不管是精神之光，还是皮肤淫滥，我们尽一切可能榨取活力源，to feel alive 以感受存在 。否则就要被淹死。

我发现这种思维方式的转变给我带来种种莫名其妙的刚正面的勇气。
我种种狂悖行为的背后逻辑是：如果不让我现在爽一把，那我要这铁棒还有何用？纵使来日方长余生漫漫又有啥乐趣？且乐呵一天就算赚到一天。

在前面的文章和朋友圈里我不断提及自己的理想是再去读个文科博士。
我目前的水平还是过于业余，我需要更专业的武装。
但是事实上我对于这件事情目前还是毫无头绪，没有行动方案。
因为我不知道我想研究的学问到底算是个什么学科。
那么我们且一项一项地排除。
历史？虽然我喜欢历史，但我对考据毫无兴趣。在我看来，考据历史不过是清洗数据，我更感兴趣的是建模，是算命是预言，是基于过去真实发生的历史大数据构建模型，对未来做出预测。
其他纯文科思辨的学科？好像也不是。我想研究的是某种文理结合的东西，包含定性和定量的内容。我对能解释一切的学问嗤之以鼻。它必须要能做出预言。
经济学？可能更接近一些，但我想研究的范畴并不局限于经济活动，还包括社会政治，甚而是精神领域。
我现在还没有发现能具体对得上号的学科。我隐约觉得用得上的内容有哲学，社会学，地缘政治学，人口学，经济学等等。这个我得继续研究。

### **第二，我想竞选国会议员。**我上黑格尔哲学课的一个感受是：那些大哲学家其实都是怀有政治理想的吧。
虽然他们在讲宇宙，讲存在和精神，讲各种林林总总。但听在我耳中却通篇都是在讲政治，讲社会伦理，讲人和人的关系，人和世界的关系。
上至庙堂下至平民，都憧憬着某种理想世界，概莫能免。不管是复旦里一心治学的教授，还是猫腻这样网络小说的作者。

我希望庆国的人民都能成为不羁之民。受到他人虐待时有不屈服之心，受到灾恶侵袭时有不受挫折之心，若有不正之事不恐惧修正之心，不向豺虎献媚。

猫腻 《庆余年》

这是我在强哥那里蹭看了几集《庆余年》印象比较深刻的句子。这是作者的政治抱负。
那我的理想国又是什么样呢？
我现在只有模糊的轮廓，还有许多困惑不解，我将以某种形式继续探索。

在强哥那里聊起当年，他已经完全不记得当年大学入学时他说过他是一个文学青年，想成为季羡林这样的大师。
我们没有继续聊下去。我不确定我当年说的话是不是有人记得。
But I still remember. 但我仍然记得。
我说的是，我想成为一个政治家。
说起这个词，我不知道听到的人脑子里浮现的是什么形象。而我现在脑子里想的是像富兰克林、汉密尔顿、杰弗逊这样的人。当然这跟我当年说这话时候的认知已经大不一样了。

**为什么我不能好好地继续做好本职工作，把专业的事交给专业的人来做？**

实在是我满眼看去都是各种各样的傻逼。以至于无脑之言横行于世，胡言乱语成为爆款文章，正经科班出身的却也拿不出一篇入得了眼的反驳文。
想想也是，那些有天分的人都去搞自然科学和工程学科了，却让一帮没有天分的猴子和没有骨气的文人来左右人们的思想，决定国家的政策和未来。
Pathetic.

怎可把世界拱手让给傻逼和坏胚？

**为什么我不能像一些粉红建议的那样，如果我对国家不满就去考公务员从政？**

1. 权力结构决定，无论基层有多少微小的进步，都阻止不了上层翻桌子重来。
事情需要根本性地解决。首先要解决框架问题，其后才是细节填充。
2. 公务员培养的更多是事务官，是官僚，是吏。他们并没有伸张自我政治主张的自由。
3. 现实我见过不少从基层做起的实干派。他们的认识已经锁死在那套话语体系，和他们多说一句话我都感觉厌烦。我当然不会让自己再多添一个反例。
So, I'll choose another way. 所以我会选择另一条路。
首先我们要做的是研究认识层面的问题，搞明白真实的精神和原理。
然后再去研究应用层面的事，看看具体能做些什么。

当然这个目标的实现取决于很多外在因素，无法断言一定可以实现。
暂且以二十年为期。
十年教训十年生聚。

### **第三，我要继续研究金融市场。**1. 金融市场是我们获取信息的窗口。
所有政治经济的动向会第一时间反映在金融市场。

2. 金融市场是我们验证自己认识正确与否的试金石。
如果你真是这么牛逼的头脑，对世界有如此贴近真实的认知以至于能做出预言，那证明给我们看啊？
我前面的文章讲过，成年人没有教育的价值。让傻逼承认他们是傻逼是不可能的事。那大家赌一把好了。抢走傻逼的钱才是正确的教育方式。

3. 我觉得可能是将来保障财务独立的重要手段。
我竭力避免使用财务自由这个词。因为在我看来那些整天满嘴财务自由的人都是无聊的没什么独立思考能力的家伙。财务自由在很多人那里是个相当模糊接近于无穷的概念。
当我和Mark不约而同问出为什么要财务自由时，有人提到选择权。事实上我觉得这也不是个让人信服的观点。选择权并不是毫无代价的，实际上是拿你的时间来换取。我见过太多根本不知道自己要什么的人，却在拼命追逐选择权。如果我明确知道自己要什么不要什么，我干嘛要浪费多余的时间精力去追逐不必要的选择权？

**为什么我不能如亮哥所说全力投入股票事业？**

股票投资使人更有动力去研究世界的广泛关联性，对时政热点产业动态做更多研究，而不是只把目光局限在自己的一亩三分地。
但我同时也见过不少全职炒股的投资者，他们的认识是封闭的，并不足以对全貌有所认知。缺少深入的社会分工协作，使人倾向于用闭合的思维逻辑解释一切。
这并不符合我们的根本目标。换言之，金融投资不过是我们认识世界过程中的副产品。

### **第四，我需要一份深入参与社会分工的正经工作。**关于工作，我目前真的是心情复杂，严重的消极怠工，一点想工作的动力都没有。如果真的没有什么特别合我心意的，我还真是宁可一个人炒股养家。
一个牛逼闪闪的领导和一个合作无间的团队真是件可遇不可求的事。十年来也就那么几个月的时间遇到那么一个半个吧。也不说其他人就没有可取之处，领导之所以是领导自然有他独特的地方。只是我们有独立的评价标准，借用一句我校校歌来说就是：器识为先，文艺其从。

就在刚刚我躺床上时我想了想我还是有很多理由需要一份正经工作，让我重新燃起了那么一点动力。
首先，我要把数据科学的技能点满。这个工具性的东西，在我还没有明确的研究方案前，还需要进一步地掌握和熟练应用。将来用得上。
其次，我一直想研究下关于hive mind的事。但总觉得自己目前的功力不足以驾驭。继续积累社会参与分工协作经验很有必要，很多认知和技能层面的东西还需要打磨。
对第一目标来说，第一手的实践经验是直接的素材。我总担心自己成为一个脱离实际的傻逼。
对第二目标来说，则是维持灵敏嗅觉和战斗技能的需要。如果将来的结论是对抗。那么我们就得比奸恶之徒更奸更恶。We scam the scammers. 
当然，工作形式可以不限，无论是企业、NGO、社团、党派，但是保持深度的社会参与性则是必要。

### **第五，我还需要generator/discriminator/enhancer.**说人话就是：我需要一个女人和一群伙伴。
我需要一些人来触发灵感，需要一些人来帮我修剪过于发散的想法，还需要有一些人来不谋而合地印证我们不那么肯定的观点。

我迟迟不肯settle down安定下来的一大原因，就是我不能把自己重要的东西轻易予人。
如果你让某人成为你生活重要的一部分，就是把discriminator这样生杀予夺的权柄交给他，使其拥有某种赏善罚恶的能力。此事重大，非价值和智识相当之人不可轻易托付。
另外如果和智力较低或是平庸的人待久了，还有强化愚蠢平庸的风险。此事我亲眼所见，不能不慎。
关于择偶观和择友观，目前我的想法还不足够成熟。而且和我想研究的hive mind问题很有关系。这个问题以后再详谈。

以上五件是我目前想到想要去做的事情。其他还有很多细小的事项和体验性的目标，这些小目标以后有机会再说吧。大的框架就是这样。

*说明：
最后讲讲我为什么非要把自己的想法说出来。
因为传统上我们总是被教育把目标藏在心底，一步一个脚印地努力，不声不响干大事。那些说出想法的人常常被说是无志之人长立志，或者又是什么枪打出头鸟啦木秀于林之类的。
实际上那也是我以前的信条和行事风格。
但是我直觉上觉得这样的教条过于陈腐，并不合于现代精神。
So I choose not. 所以我选择不那样做。*

*有以下三重考量：
1. 贯彻我们think aloud大声思考的原则。
2. 训练自己focus专注的能力。
简而言之，如果说出来以后就觉得压力山大，那是给了别人太多他们不应得的注意力。闷声发大财一点都不刺激，显不出能耐。在众目睽睽之下把事情办成才是本事。
3. 吸引同类。*
