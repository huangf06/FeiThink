# Ever since I firmly grasped self-centeredness in my own hands, I have become stronger than before, possessing the spirit of “what do they matter to me?”... My anxiety has completely disappeared, and I can now survey gloomy London with a relaxed heart.

Natsume Sōseki, *My Individualism*

Ever since I encountered the term “self-centeredness” in Natsume Sōseki’s *My Individualism*, the concept of subjectivity has lingered in my mind.

**Subjectivity is the individual’s experience and perception of the world.** Philosophically, **subjective experience is the foundation of existence**—as Descartes put it, “I think, therefore I am.”

I wouldn’t say I particularly lack subjectivity. I’ve always been unconventional, both in thought and experience. Yet this concept struck me immediately upon first encounter, keeping me up nights recently trying to understand it fully. First, because it perfectly encapsulates the cultural differences I’ve observed between East and West. Second, because it reveals something missing in my own framework—something about inferiority and transcendence.

## **Inferiority and Transcendence**I’ve always felt a deep sense of unworthiness, as if I don’t deserve the best things this world has to offer.

I remember late-night dorm room conversations in college about girlfriends. Back then, I was deeply anxious about meeting a girl’s parents, as though someone’s daughter raised for eighteen years was somehow being ruined by me.

Years have passed, yet this sense of unworthiness still shadows me.

I used to think my inferiority stemmed from constantly comparing myself to perfection—competing with an omniscient, omnipotent God, a battle naturally doomed to eternal defeat. So we square the circle, gradually approaching perfection. Though we can never reach it, we’re always on the path toward it. This is where my account name “Regular Heptadecagon” (正十七) comes from.

But is this really the case? What we call perfection is just a chimera—a patchwork creature cobbled together from the best qualities we see in others.

From my crude understanding of intelligence: an intelligence just two levels above yours would be unrecognizable and incomprehensible, even if placed right before you—much less something you’d worship and pursue. Similarly, our notion of perfection is nothing but deeply subjective imagination, with ourselves as the center and our understanding as the radius.

Why is our image of perfection a chimera, a polygon of different dimensions, rather than a single mountain peak? Because each dimension of this polygon reflects different expectations others have of us, manifested in our consciousness. So here’s what’s likely happening: though we claim to pursue perfection, what we’re really craving deep down is simply acceptance from others.

At its root, our sense of unworthiness may stem from having lived according to others’ expectations for so long—playing NPC-like supporting roles in their scripts, living the lives others expected of us, without true subjectivity of our own. Unable to declare from the depths of our being:

O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space—were it not that I have bad dreams.

Shakespeare, *Hamlet*

## **The Origins of Unworthiness**So how did this happen? When was this seed of unworthiness planted in me?

**Was it my family of origin?**

My European friends ask why I never go home for holidays. I tell them I can’t live peacefully with my parents for more than three days. But I don’t really buy theories about “family of origin” or “childhood trauma.” My parents were far from perfect, but looking back, my childhood was free and unstructured. Their laissez-faire, hands-off approach actually gave me freedom to exercise my own agency. Conflicts with my parents mostly emerged after I became an adult, and even those conflicts now seem like necessary catalysts for spiritual independence.

**Was it society’s hierarchical culture?**

I once read a brilliantly apt summary:

**China’s universal value is bullying the weak and fearing the strong; China’s traditional wisdom is identifying who’s weak and who’s strong in the shortest time with the least information.**

This can all be explained by survival-first philosophy and jungle society assumptions. But I fundamentally question this survival philosophy. Is such a life really worth living? Why is survival such a luxury for us that people must sacrifice everything else noble to secure it? This is also why I don’t think much of Liu Cixin—his *Three-Body Problem* is entirely about this survival philosophy. As someone astutely observed: others write space opera; he writes space Yu opera.

## **Conform or Rebel?**Should people conform to their nature or resist their instincts?

Our self-consciousness is the only proof we’ve lived in this world, and our subjectivity manifests through adventure and resistance.

True freedom is the attitude of pushing yourself back up after you’ve rolled to the bottom.

Some third-rate writer once said: “Life has three stages of growth: discovering you’re not the center of the world, discovering that no matter how hard you try some things remain impossible, and accepting your ordinariness and learning to enjoy it.”

I’d revise that and add one more:

**Rediscovering your individual value and reclaiming center stage.**

Natsume Sōseki beautifully described this journey from other-centeredness to self-centeredness in *My Individualism*:

Ah, here lies my path forward! I’ve finally excavated this road! When such an exclamation cries out from the depths of your heart, the weight on your chest will finally lift. For those troubled by fog along the way, I believe that no matter what sacrifices they must make, they should dig until they reach the ore deposit. When they arrive there, they’ll discover this is truly where they belong. I believe this is how one gains lifelong self-confidence and finally settles one’s heart.

Natsume Sōseki, *My Individualism*

## **Misunderstanding Individualism**When it comes to individualism, people often confuse it with egoism. Though they appear similar, the difference is vast. Egoism focuses only on maximizing one’s own interests and may harm others for self-benefit. Individualism, however, embodies a universal principle—it emphasizes individual freedom and rights while acknowledging and respecting others’ equal rights. Egoism leads to a war of all against all, a jungle society under dark forest rules; individualism can lead to a state where each person is free and fulfilled, without everyone becoming batteries serving the Matrix.

## **How to Practice Individualism**A crucial concept is **separation of tasks**.

All human troubles stem from interpersonal relationships. Wherever we go, we’re surrounded by others, living as social beings within webs of relationships, unable to escape this net of human connections. It seems only by gaining others’ approval can we feel valuable.

**But the path to freedom is one of not being approved.** The pursuit of approval kills freedom. A life spent trying to please everyone is profoundly unfree—and impossible besides.

When we try to please others, we implicitly assume that if we live and act according to their expectations, we deserve reciprocation—their approval and acceptance.

But this assumption secretly degrades others’ subjectivity, as if their wills can be manipulated by our actions, as if their wills are mere extensions of our own. As long as I give unilaterally, others should naturally reciprocate—so goes the logic.

Mutual benefit is certainly healthy in relationships, but it must be agreed upon by both parties. Unilateral giving while expecting return is, to some degree, emotional manipulation. This is common in unequal relationships—parents toward children, superiors toward subordinates.

**All interpersonal conflicts arise from interfering in others’ tasks.**

Separating tasks is the starting point of healthy relationships. We must begin by asking “whose task is this?” and separate our own tasks from others’. The criterion for distinguishing whose task it is: **who will ultimately bear the consequences of the choice?**

Regarding your own life, all you can do is choose the path you believe is best. How others evaluate your choices is their task—you simply cannot control it. Trying to interfere with or shoulder others’ tasks makes your life heavy and painful, and often produces backlash.

## **The Individual as Subject**From my experience, I prefer people with subjectivity. I once talked with a Dutch girl who told me Chinese people have a habit of trying to figure out what others think, then saying what others want to hear. This behavior itself is annoying—more so than honestly expressing yourself and saying the wrong thing—because you’re ignoring my will and guessing what I want based on your own assumptions, trying to decide for me what I should like.

I understand that some people do this out of respect, positioning themselves as subordinate, afraid of touching a nerve like servants attending an emperor. But I increasingly dislike this worldview of ranking people by status.

One problem with befriending someone with an inferiority complex is that they carry hierarchy in their hearts, and as their friend, they’ll drag you down to kneel with them. For example, Teacher Da has a distinction between officials and common people in his mind. When he acts inferior before officials, he drags me—a fellow commoner—down with him. But I don’t respect civil servants one bit. Or when we went to see tulips in the Netherlands and a passerby stopped some Indians from trampling the flower fields, I told my companion, “Let’s do the same if we see it.” He replied, “Too bad you’re not white.” I thought to myself, *my heart is white*.

This is why I increasingly like people who are fearless—at least you don’t have to worry about being dragged down to kneel.

People exist as powerless beings in this world. We want to escape this powerlessness, which gives rise to the universal desire for what Adler called “striving for superiority.”

Wanting to progress, pursuing an ideal state—these are understandable, even healthy impulses.

**But striving for superiority means continuously moving forward yourself, not placing yourself above others.**

Healthy feelings of inferiority don’t come from comparing yourself with others, but from continuous self-transcendence—pursuing your ideal self.

自从我把自我本位紧紧地掌握在自己手中后，我变得比从前更加强大，拥有了「他们算得了什么」的气概……我的忐忑不安完全消失了，我已能带着轻松的心情纵目四望阴郁的伦敦。

夏目漱石 《我的个人主义》

自从在夏目漱石的《我的个人主义》里接触到自我本位这个词汇，主体性这一概念就在我的脑子里挥之不去。

**主体性，就是个体对世界的体验和感知**。哲学上认为，**主观体验是存在的基础**，所谓『我思故我在』。

关于主体性，我很难说自己特别欠缺，自己一直以来都特立独行，不管是思想，还是经历。但是主体性这个概念仍然甫一初见就打动了我，让我最近一段不眠不休地想要把这个问题搞明白。一是因为这个词确实很好地概括了我所观感的东西方文化差异，二是因为它揭示了在我的体系里某些欠缺的东西，关于自卑和超越。

**自卑和超越**

一直有种深深的不配感，感觉好像自己不配享受这世上最美好的东西。

想起大学宿舍夜话女生的话题时，自己彼时深自担忧去见女生家长这种事，好像别人养了十八年的女儿怎么就被自己糟蹋了一样。

多年过去了，这种不配感好像还是如影随形。

以往我认为自卑是因为自己总是在和完美比较，是在和全知全能的上帝作比，那当然是永恒的挫败。所以，我们要割圆为方，要渐趋逼近，虽然完美永远无法达到，但我们总是在接近完美的路上。这也就是公号名字「正十七」的由来。

可是，当真如此吗？所谓完美，不过是我们把那些别人身上好的东西都集于一身的一个捏合在一起的四不象罢了。

就以我对智能的粗浅理解来说，比你高上两级的智能即使摆在你面前你也认不出来无法理解，更遑论去崇拜追求这样的东西。同样的道理，我们心中的完美也不过是一个充满主观性的想象，它以我们的立足为圆心，以我们的思想认知为半径。

而为什么我们的完美形象是一个四不象，是一个充满不同维度的多边形，而不是一座单一的山峰呢？那是因为多边形的各个维度是他人的不同期待在我们意识里的反映。所以事情很可能是这样，虽然我们嘴上在叫嚷着追求完美，可实际上心底里疯狂呼唤的只是他人的接纳。

究其本源，我们的不配感可能是来源于长久以来我们都是在按照他人的期待生活，在别人的剧本里扮演着NPC一般的边缘角色，过着他人期待的生活，而没有自己真正的主体性，无法发自肺腑地喊出那句：

即使身处果壳之中，我仍是无限宇宙之王！

莎士比亚《哈姆雷特》

**不配感的起源**

何以如此，我在想我这种不配感的种子是从何时种下？

是原生家庭吗？

我欧洲的朋友问我为啥过节都不回家的，我跟他们说我和父母没法和平住一起超过三天。但我并不怎么信服「原生家庭」「童年创伤」这种理论，我的父母当然称不上完美，但回想我的童年是自由自在的，正因父母的不加干涉和放养，才给了我更多主观能动性的自由发挥。和父母的冲突更多是在成年以后，而即便这种冲突现在看来也是我们精神独立所必要的催化剂。

是社会的等级文化吗？

看过一句话总结很是精当：

**中国的普世价值就是欺软怕硬；而中国的传统智慧就是在最短的时间内，用最少量的已知条件，辨认出谁软谁硬。**

这些当然都可以用生存至上的哲学和丛林社会的假设加以解释。但是，我从根本上质疑这种生存哲学，这样的生活真的值得过吗？何以生存于我们而言是如此一项奢侈，以至于人要牺牲其他一切崇高的东西来保障它？这也是我为什么不怎么看得上刘慈欣，就因为他的《三体》写的全是这种生存哲学。所以有人锐评：别人写的是太空歌剧，而他写的是太空豫剧。

**顺从还是反抗？**

人活在世上，到底是应该顺从本性还是应该对抗本能？

我们的自我意识是我们在世上存活过的唯一证明，而我们的主体性就是在冒险和反抗中得以彰显。

真正的自由是一种把滚落下来的自己从下面往上推的态度。

有个三流作家说过一段话：「人生有三次成长：一是发现自己不再是世界的中心的时候，二是发现再怎么努力也无能为力的时候，三是接受自己的平凡并去享受平凡的时候。」

我要给他改动改动再加上一句貂尾续狗，那就是：

**重新发现个体价值，再次夺回舞台正中央的那一刻。**

夏目漱石在《我的个人主义》很好描述了从他人本位到达自我本位后的心路：

啊，这里有我前进的道路！我好不容易才掘出了这条路！当这样的感叹从内心深处呐喊出来的时候，你心上的那块石头才会落地吧？如果途中有因遇到雾霭而懊恼的人，我想，无论付出多么大的牺牲，他也应该挖掘到矿床之处之住手。如果走到那里，他就会发现事实上这里才有自己落座的地方。我认为，这样才能使自己获得终生的自信，并从此安下心来。

夏目漱石《我的个人主义》

**个人主义的误解**

说到个人主义，人们常把它和利己主义混为一谈。但二者虽然看上去相似，但其中的差别有若云泥。利己主义只关注如何最大化自己的利益，可能会损人利己。而个人主义则涵有一种普世性的原则，它强调个体的自由和权利，同时也承认并尊重他人同样的权利。利己主义导向的是所有人对所有人的战争，一个黑暗森林法则下的丛林社会；而个人主义则可以通向一种每个个体都自由饱满的状态，而不必要人人都成为服务于矩阵的电池。

**个人主义该怎么做**

一个重要的概念是**课题分离**。

人的烦恼皆源于人际关系。无论我们走到哪里都被他人包围着，都是活在与他人的关系之中的社会性的个人，无论如何都逃不出人际关系这张坚固的大网。似乎只有得到他人的认可，我们才能体会到自己有价值。

**但自由之路就是一条得不到认可的路**。对认可的追求，扼杀了自由。八面玲珑地讨好所有人的生活方式是一种极其不自由的生活方式，同时也是不可能实现的事情。

我们在讨好他人时，潜在的假设是只要我们按照他人的期待生活行事，我们就理应得到他人回报，得到别人的认可和接纳。

但这种假设却暗自贬低了他人的主体性，似乎别人的意志可以由我们的行为来操纵，别人的意志不过是我们主体性的延伸。只要我单方面的付出，那么别人就理当同样地回报于我。

互惠互利当然是一种良好的人际状态，但却必须经由当事双方的同意而缔约。单方面又期待回报的付出，从某种程度上说，就是一种情感勒索。常见于不对等的关系，比如父母之于子女，上位者之于下位者。

**一切人际关系的矛盾都起因于对别人的课题妄加干涉。**

而分离课题就是人际关系的出发点。我们必须从「这是谁的课题」出发，把自己的课题与别人的课题分离开。而辨别课题属于谁的标准就是**看选择所带来的结果最终要由谁来承受**。

关于自己的人生你能够做的就只有选择自己认为最好的道路。而至于别人怎么评价你的选择，那是别人的课题，你根本无法左右。试图干涉甚至担负别人的课题会让自己的人生沉重而痛苦，而且往往会产生强烈的反作用。

**作为主体的个人**

以我的个人经验来说，我也更喜欢那些有主体性的个人。之前和一位荷兰姑娘交流，她告我说中国人的习惯总是喜欢揣摩别人的想法，然后拣别人爱听的话说。这个行为本身就很招人烦，比你坦诚地表达然后说错话更甚，因为你在无视我的意志而纯粹按着自己的经验来揣测我，试图帮我决定我该喜欢什么。

我完全可以理解，有些人这样做其实是出于尊重，把自己置于下位，像伺候皇上一样怕触到逆鳞。但我整体上越来越不喜欢这样把人分尊卑的处世哲学。

和自卑者交朋友的一个不好地方是他自己心里有尊卑，而你是他的朋友，他会拉着你一起下跪。比如大老师心里有官民之分，他见官自卑的时候也连带上同为平民的我，可老子打心眼里一点儿也看不上公务员。再比如在荷兰去看郁金香，有路人制止乱闯花田的印度人，我跟同行的小伙伴说，待会儿我们也这么干。他给我来一句，可惜你不是白皮。我心说他妈的老子心白。

这就是我为什么越来越喜欢那些无法无天的人，至少你不会担心被拉着下跪。

人是作为一种无力的存在活在这个世界上。人希望摆脱这种无力感，继而就有了「追求优越性」的普遍欲求。

希望进步，追求理想状态，这些都无可厚非，也不全是坏事。

**但追求优越性是指自己不断朝前迈进，而不是比别人高出一等。**

健全的自卑感不是来自与他人的比较，而是不断超越，追求理想的自己。
