This afternoon I read something about Mathew Pottinger, and I was inspired by his encouraging deeds. He said in 2005, "Living in China shows you a nondemocratic country can do to its citizens." While his experience of repression in China had fired his patriotism, I've fired my anti-patriotism. If you really love your country and people, how can you ignore their sufferings? 
下午读了一些关于马修波廷格的东西，被他的人生经历鼓舞了。他在2005年说，在X国的生活给你展示了一个非MZ的国家可以怎么对待他的公民。他说他在X国的压抑经历点燃了他的爱国热情，对我则是点燃了我的反爱国主义。如果你真的在乎国家和人民，你怎么能忽视他们的痛苦？

I've been told by many people that you shall see the better side. No. I said no. I choose the truth. Most of the better part has nothing to do with the government.In a larger and higher vision, achievements are just the success of market and nature. You loosen the control of your people and the prosperity is naturally guaranteed.
经常有人跟我说，你要看到好的方面。我说拉倒吧。事情是怎么样就是怎么样。大多数好的部分跟一些人有啥关系？从更高的视角来看，基本是市场和规律的成功。你放松控制，它就自发繁荣。及格和优秀是两码事。

Counting coppers is never my greatest interest. Mathew's career switch is an inspiration to me. And now I should do something of more meanings and fun.
数钱好像不是我最大乐趣。马修的职业生涯转变对我是个鼓舞。我们应该做些更有意义和乐趣的事。

Now the party is more like a virus or a cancer, it used too much resources to make itself survive, ignoring the real healthcare of the country.If I am a selfish man, I can choose to ignore and keep moving. Maybe I am, maybe not. We'll see.I want to see the bigger picture through my world-wide travel.Then I'll see what we can do next. To live with it, or to change it. When Chenjie Wang said you are nothing, you over-estimate yourself. I say fuck him. No matter how little difference we can make, we move towards a larger goal, that makes our lives count.
现在X团体更像是一种病毒或者癌细胞，占用太多资源来确保自己的生存，而无视寄主的健康状况。如果我是一个自私的人，我可以选择无视只管埋头过好自己的生活。至于我是不是还存疑。回头再看。我想通过世界之旅看到一个更大的图景。然后可以看看接下来能做什么。当王三说你太高估你自己的时候，我心说一边凉快去。不管我们能做的改变有多小，至少是在向一个更大的目标努力，那就足够使一切有了意义。

Now what I should do is:
我现在要做的事：

1. to improve English. Chinese information environments are polluted badly. We shall get my information and data from more reliable sources.
提高英语。中文信息环境污染太严重。我们应该从更可靠的来源获取信息。

2. to find a place in a free world. Germany is a good choice. So to improve my German is also a must.
在自由世界找到一个容身之地。德国是个好选项。所以同时还要提高德语。

3. even I'm tired of desperate struggling, I still believe that a more tense life is essential to me. We do not fight for illusions any more, but we still should fight for something real. Work more than 12 hours every day. My holiday is over.
即使我现在对奋斗脱敏，我仍然觉得某种更紧张的生活对我很重要。我们对为虚幻而奋斗脱敏，但还是应该为真实奋斗。所以，接下来继续一天工作12小时以上。假期结束了。

4. I think my ex-boss is right, which he said we do not appreciate an explosive and passionate struggle. We should make smooth efforts. We shall trust the power of time and serenity. We make a long-run plan and make efforts day by day. Do not be frightened by your lack of knowledge and capabilities at present. Based on what you can do now, try to struggle for more and break through the limits. Maybe one day you look back, you'll see, "Aha, it's not that difficult." Even not, you are bettering yourself. 
我认为我前老板说得很有道理，他说努力不应该是激情爆发式的。我们应该更平和地用功。我们应该相信时间的威力，相信宁静理性的威力。制定长期的计划，然后一点一点实现。不要被眼前自己的无知和能力不足吓倒，应该抛弃不切实际地幻想基于现在的真实能力圈做出行动，在圆圈周围努力做得更多，一点点突破边界。可能将来有天回头看发现，“哈，也没那么难”。即使发现是真TMD的难，那也功不唐捐。

5. Be humble. It's not a rule which others restrict us. It's a choice by my will. Usually I use arrogance to screen noise and boring people. But I find it often blurs my mind. It often leads you to a condition of a fight against traditions, which is a waste of time, often breaks the serenity of our minds even you are talking about facts and leaves you blind to dangers and risks. And it costs too much time and efforts to recover to serenity afterwards. That's the annoying part. 
谦逊。这不是一个别人强加于我们的规则，这是我现在反复思虑觉得必要的策略。通常我用傲慢来过滤噪声和无聊的人。但是我发现经常搞砸。常常发现它让你陷入一个需要和传统反抗的境地，即使你跟他们讲的是事实。这是浪费时间，时常要打破头脑的平静让肾上腺素飙升去应对战斗，同时让我们对真正的风险盲目失去警惕。完了还需要浪费时间和精力去恢复平静。这是非常烦人的一点。实在是看不见真相只会看到鸡毛蒜皮的无聊的人太多了。跟他们纠缠是我傻逼。
