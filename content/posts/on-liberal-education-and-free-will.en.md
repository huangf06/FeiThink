Today on SMTH BBS, I saw an article titled “For Rural Children Going to College, More Important Than Choosing a Major Is Elevating Thinking and Vision.” Though I’m a rural child myself, and a few years ago I might have considered this golden advice, today I can no longer relate to it.

But one question posed in the article does align with my recent thinking:

In modern society, are techniques and skills more advanced than thinking and cognition?

## **Liberal Education**Many people don’t understand why the Romans called education “liberal education”—education for free citizens. My understanding is that once a person’s intelligence crosses a certain threshold, it means that for you, higher-level conscious self-awareness is far more important than any particular professional skill. Because spiritual self-awakening means the possibility of deeper exploration both inward and outward. The importance of this boundary expansion crushes the significance of any single craft to one’s life. This is why the more elite the university, the more it loves discussing “useless arts.” The lower the tier of the school, the more it resembles a vocational technical college.

This resonates with my impressions from recent years.

Standing on the Philosophers’ Walk in Heidelberg, I first learned about the concept of liberal education and suddenly felt that the past was wrong and today is right. I felt this was the education more suited to me—the path of self-cultivation leading to personal integrity.

Liberal education might be the only systematic opportunity to learn the big picture after becoming an adult. The reduction of individuals to mere cogs in a machine is a tragedy humanity currently cannot solve, and liberal education is the only means education has had since ancient times to resist such instrumentalization.

## **Free Will**For most people, the existence of free will is doubtful.

Everyone has many layers of thinking habits at different depths, which are the parameters at various levels defining their character. Changing surface-level parameters is relatively easy; changing deep-level parameters is very difficult. Human inertia prevents most people from changing their deep-level parameters, manifested in not being open enough—it’s very hard to improve their thinking patterns through communication.

Weibo @Laojiiewangshen

Actually, “inertia” here isn’t quite accurate. I think the more precise word is *momentum*.

Observing crowds, you can clearly feel that human consciousness is constrained by invisible nets. Many people are completely unaware of the problem, unaware that deeper levels of existence remain. Some people can perceive contradictions in their understanding but have no heart or strength to change. The underlying principle is probably this: if they begin questioning their cognition, they’re pulling out the faith on which they depend. And not everyone is willing or able to endure this pain. Thus they can only run on inertia along predetermined tracks. The manifestation is being trapped in invisible nets.

So I actually agree with Dolores’s words in *Westworld*:

Free will exists, it’s just very difficult.

*Westworld*, Dolores

It’s truly work requiring both wisdom and courage: Wisdom enough to make you aware of the problem; Courage enough to make you flip the table and start over.

Therefore it belongs only to the few, only to the outliers.

今天在水木上看到一篇文章《农村孩子上大学，比学专业更重要的，是提升思维和境界》。
虽然我是农村孩子，放在几年前我可能觉得是金玉良言，但时至今日我已无法感同身受。

但文中抛出的一个问题确是和我近日思考相合：

现代社会，技术和技能比思维和认知更高级吗？

## 博雅教育很多人不理解为什么罗马人管教育要叫liberal education，自由民教育。
我的理解是，人一旦智力在某个分界线以上，就意味着对你来说，更高层次的意识自觉比某个职业技能要重要得多。
因为精神自我觉醒意味着对内对外都进行更深的探究的可能。
这种边界的扩展的重要性碾压单个技艺对人生的意义，这就是为什么越是顶尖大学越是喜欢探讨无用之术。层次越低的学校看着越像职业技术学院。

跟我近些年来的感观一致。

站在海德堡的哲学家小道上，第一次了解到博雅教育的概念，顿有今是昨非之感。
觉得这才是更适合自己的教育——通向人格完整的自我完善之路。

博雅教育是成年之后可能唯一的一次系统学习big picture的机会。
个体的螺丝钉化是人类目前无法解决的悲哀，而博雅教育是自古以来教育阶段仅有的反工具化手段。

## 自由意志自由意志对大多数人来说存在性是值得怀疑的。

每个人都有许多层不同深度的思维习惯，是定义其人设的各级参数。
改变表层参数相对容易，改变底层参数很费劲。
人的惰性使多数人不能改变自己的底层参数，体现在不够open，很难通过沟通改善其思维方式。

微博@老界王神

其实这里说惰性不够准确。
我觉得更准确的词是惯性。

观察人群你可以清晰地感觉到人的意识被无形的网所限制。
很多人根本意识不到问题，意识不到还有更深层次的存在。
一些人可以意识到认识的矛盾，但无心或无力改变。
大概原理是如果他们开始质疑自己的认知，就是抽掉自己赖以维持的信仰。
而这种痛苦并不是所有人都愿意或者能够承受。
因而只能在既定的轨道上惯性运行。
表现出来就是被无形的网困锁。

所以我倒是赞同《西部世界》里德妹的话：

自由意志是存在的，只是很难罢了。

《西部世界》德洛芮丝

简直是一份需要智勇兼备的工作：
智足以让你意识到问题；
勇足以让你推桌子重来。

因而其只属于少数人，只属于那些outlier.
