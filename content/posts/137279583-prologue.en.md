On the occasion of turning 29, I'm opening this space for writing.

## Why create this space?

### Birthday Commemoration

I have a strong desire to celebrate my own birthday.  
Perhaps it's because 29 is a prime number, which aligns with my aesthetic sense of numbers.  
There are also forgotten promises, a sense of ritual, and other reasons.  
I'm jotting down my thoughts at this moment to commemorate it in the future.

### The Measure of Time

The denominator of memory has grown so large that while new ideas and experiences increase, their proportion diminishes, and the threshold continues to rise.  
Time distorts and accelerates in subjective perception. We need something to balance out this confusion.  
Calendars are too thin; some people use film, landmarks, food, stamp collections (sleeping around)... I use words and thoughts.

### Soul Searching

The heart gathers dust and needs to be questioned from time to time. An unexamined life is not worth living.

I open this small pond, to wash away the dust and for personal reflection, letting anyone participate freely.

## What do I want to achieve?

### Literary Version

May it cleanse away the filth and allow clarity of heart,  
transcend simple repetition and distinguish chaos from disorder,  
give time its vitality and the soul its depth.

### Plainspoken Version

Fuck the flowery language above.

This is just a place to freely vent and curse, to write whatever I want.

Who am I? I am an independent and free thinker. I disregard all the rules imposed by the outside world—laws, morals, ethics, social norms, common sense—none of them concern me. Are laws and rules made for people like us?

When writing in other places, there's always too much noise in my head, constantly considering how others might perceive it.  
I can't freely express rebellious, shocking, or pretentious thoughts. It's suffocating.

## What will I write about?

### Topics

Stocks, history, current affairs, film reviews, the way of the world, human nature, data, code, food, relationships... Whatever, have fun!

New ideas, novel toys, or simply tossing out a question to be answered later. Anywhere the brain can be used, anything that can be played with.

### Principles

Big or small, nothing is off-limits—go ahead and do as you please.

No promotions, no buying followers, no need to impress anyone. Enjoy yourself!

It symbolizes the idea of "squaring the circle," where a perfect circle belongs to the divine realm, and humans can only turn circles into squares, inching toward that perfection. The plan is to master 17 fields of study.</small>
