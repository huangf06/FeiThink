# In Memory of an Ordinary Man: Dr. Li Wenliang


Even as grief and rage flood social media, everyone knows things won’t change quickly.

Power remains in the hands of the old guard of this dying era. They will fight to the death to protect their privileges.

Millions protesting for months couldn’t make those in power change course.

Much less a few choked sobs stuck in your throats.

If all they do is punish a few officials, if all they do is issue an apology, nothing will have changed.

As long as the lockdown on speech isn’t lifted, this isn’t over.

As long as this doesn’t establish an ironclad red line, it will happen again.

But that ironclad red line doesn’t lie in laws or armed police.

It lies in your hearts—hearts clouded with grease.

If you meekly surrender your rights and freedoms without a fight, don’t ever claim you’re serving the nation. The nation has no use for spineless descendants like you. Your endless tolerance fattens the parasites, breaks the pillars, and crushes innocent, meritorious heroes to death.

You think you can’t change anything?

That just proves the one who needs changing most is you.

**First: Educate yourself as best you can.**

Stop being so easily fooled.

When you stood on the opposite side of Hong Kong protesters, did you realize? They were demanding exactly what you’re demanding now.

So many people complain that the people are unenlightened.

Setting aside the fact that there are methods in this world to transform barbarism into civilization—you just don’t know them.

More importantly, you yourself are part of that unenlightened mass. Otherwise you wouldn’t be making such claims.

**Second: Do everything in your power to tear down the wall.**

The truth is, many of you *are* the wall itself.

A healthy society shouldn’t have only one voice.

A normal society shouldn’t have only a ruling party—it should also have an opposition party.

If no opposition party is permitted, then there should be rebels.

That’s what a normal society looks like.

If you cowards don’t dare stick your necks out, then fine—keep your heads down and scrape by for food and clothing.

But for god’s sake, stop lecturing others to be “reasonable, moderate, and positive.”

And to hell with “being constructive”—can you constructively make a tyrant step down?

When you wear down the backbone of every person with integrity in this society, you lower society’s moral baseline—because you’re not teaching people cynicism in equal measure, you’re just eroding their courage.

The government will naturally deploy resources to glorify itself. Does it need you speaking on its behalf?

One fewer shameless flatterer singing the government’s praises would make this world a better place.

**Third: You have a vote.**

Some people have real ballots. Some can vote with their feet. What everyone has is attention and money.

Your attention is power. Your bearing witness is power. Your memory is power. Your persistent questioning is power.

Your voice of support or opposition is not meaningless—public opinion monitoring agencies will detect it.

Your lifestyle, your investment and consumption choices, the money you spend and invest—that’s an even more real vote than a ballot.
