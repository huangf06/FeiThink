Shen Pangpang’s articles are evergreen—each reading brings fresh insights. Below I quote and annotate to share them with you.

## **Part One: On Life****Life is too short for roundabout strategies.**

**If you want to be a banker, study finance—don’t think about studying physics and chemistry first, then switching careers. If you want to build your career in America, go work in America—don’t spend all your time in mainland China stuck in perpetual “preparation mode.” After experiencing life’s ups and downs, I’ve finally realized: even for seemingly difficult endeavors, jumping straight in and learning by doing is actually much easier than endlessly “preparing” without taking action.**

**To achieve an ideal, you must be ready to sacrifice everything else you possess in the fight. Only this way do you have any real chance of making it happen.**

*Pangpang has already expressed this perfectly, and I have nothing more to annotate. If I must add something, it would be this: for ordinary people who have no throne to inherit, being able to discover one’s true self, recognize one’s nature and genuine goals, understand where one’s real passion lies, and then charge straight toward it with focused effort—this is far more important than learning some meaningless tricks and strategies. Always being too embarrassed to admit your goals, as if there’s some dark forest where revealing your objectives will invite unnecessary attacks, all that “the nail that sticks out gets hammered down,” “the bird that leads the flock gets shot”... all this means is that you’re granting others far more importance and attention than they deserve. For me, my life experience has also taught me that the straight line is the shortest path.*

## **Part Two: On Friends****The most precious wealth in life is friends, followed by time. Both friends and time are more valuable than money.**

**Building a circle of friends who deeply appreciate you, people with integrity who share your values and vision—life becomes as exhilarating as equipping elite gear and crushing noobs in random matches.**

**The core of social skills is the ability to quickly and accurately gauge how interested someone is in you.**

**Don’t try to befriend people who don’t like you. Encouragement from friends is one of life’s most valuable motivators. Spend time with people who don’t like you, and their constant criticism—”you’re wrong about this, you’re wrong about that”—will eventually turn you into someone who IS wrong.**

**Once you’ve made a few good friends who appreciate you, notice how you suddenly become alive and get out of your shell of being shy and passive.**

**For each friend, getting together once every two weeks is a reasonable frequency. Those who reject your invitation—even once—don’t appreciate you, and you should keep your respectful distance. Rejection is a universal expression of aversion across all cultures and peoples; it doesn’t vary by background.**

*On the topic of friends, Shen Pangpang has said it perfectly—I can’t add anything better. I can only reflect that in the past, I didn’t value friendships nearly enough.*

## **Part Three: On Character****No matter how much you admire someone’s strengths, if their character is flawed, you must keep your distance.**

**The happiest families are those where parents love each other. Loving parents lead by example, teaching their children confidence, honesty, discipline, composure, and generosity—not just making a lot of money so their kids can show off in front of other children.**

*I often wonder how many of the so-called traditional Chinese virtues remain relevant in modern society.*

*My German teacher brought up “harmony”—which is obviously nonsense. When the Hu-Wen administration first proposed a “harmonious society”, I thought it was a good concept—all that “unity between heaven and humanity”, “universal peace and prosperity”... But later we all learned that harmony had become a means rather than an end, so fuck that damn harmony. I’d rather they enforce strict laws and rule of law to shape society than let this damn “harmony” muddle everything into compromise; I’d rather have freedom of press and speech that exposes evil than willful blindness that paints over the truth. The former is the legitimate path to social progress—the latter isn’t worth discussing.*

*On modesty: Every time this word comes up, I recall a conversation with a state-owned enterprise executive’s driver right after graduation—the way he schemed to sniff out any trace of pride in me disgusted me thoroughly. Perhaps I did have rough edges back then, and not only have they not been smoothed down, but after turning thirty and adopting a “fuck it, I don’t care anymore” attitude, I’ve actually turned back into an angry youth. This so-called virtue can stay with those who consider it virtuous, because it obviously just increases communication costs. Everyone’s so busy—who has time to slowly excavate your hidden qualities? If modesty is truly necessary, it should only be to spare a friend’s feelings.*

*On the “favor-based society”: similarly, a custom that increases overall transaction costs for society. Its necessity stems from inadequate social safety nets and the opacity of public services. In a more robust social system, this necessity would be greatly diminished.*

*On character cultivation, I’ll use Pangpang’s list as my reference:*

**Confidence.**

**Honesty**—the older I get, the more I detest manipulation and lies. Though born in Henan, I find myself increasingly reluctant to deal with Henan people (not regional discrimination—it’s just the culture, really hard to explain in a few words; some local cultures genuinely take pride in deceiving others for amusement). From now on, honesty and integrity must be my principle. Be hardcore like Thanos: he is many things, a liar is not one of them.

**Discipline**—strict with oneself, tolerant of others.

**Composure**—ancient sayings have covered this thoroughly. Remain unshaken when crisis strikes suddenly, stay calm when provoked without cause. Face mockery and doubt with indifference. This truly requires cultivation—I still have much to learn from my friend Mark.

**Generosity**—maintain an open mind, don’t be closed off. Hoarding knowledge like a treasure has never been my style; even as a student I never feared sharing study methods. For me, the key is to think aloud—to articulate and share my thoughts.

**When choosing people to work for you, character comes first, loyalty second, and ability third.**

**When selecting young people, I prefer those who are extreme, especially those extreme individuals who look like they’ll become visionary leaders.**

**People who aren’t extreme will never be visionaries.**

**Of course, not all extreme people are visionaries either.**

*Some things, when someone else voices them for you, you immediately know they’re right. Indeed, I am not alone in my path. I’ve been criticized for being extreme since high school, because mainstream society favors the steady, middle-of-the-road approach.*

*Of course, this also reflects my own wavering faith and lack of confidence in my own judgment. But for young people with limited experience and no statistical validation, how can I know I’m right?*

*Conversely, this exposes the flaws in our education system. Which brings us to another of Pangpang’s quotes:*

**If you’re more capable than your parents, keep your distance and avoid their interference. I’ve seen quite a few talented people from mediocre families who, because they spent too much time with their parents, slowly regressed back to mediocrity.**

## **Part Four: On Going Abroad****When you go abroad, don’t stick with Chinese people.**

**Many people complain about racial discrimination from whites in America, implicitly suggesting that whites don’t face discrimination from whites. This logic is flawed—because if you weren’t born white, you cannot become white (at least not without tremendous cost). As a luckless Chinese person, I face discrimination wherever I go. But given the choice between discrimination from my Chinese compatriots in mainland China versus discrimination from whites in America, I’d take the latter. The former treats you like livestock—donkeys and horses; the latter treats you like pets—cats and dogs. Obviously the latter is more bearable.**

**...Especially for someone like me who never planned to leave China (in my youth, I actually looked down on those who went abroad—abandoning family and friends seemed so selfish), fate chose to grant me a rebirth in the New World.**

**In this world, no matter how capable I am, many things—birth, aging, sickness, death, and the movements of nature and society—are simply beyond my control...**

*For someone like me—a country mouse from rural Henan, China, dwelling at the very bottom of the social hierarchy—Pangpang’s words strike a deep chord. In my youth, I fancied myself a Sakamoto Ryōma, determined to stay rooted in my homeland, stir up winds of change, and reform society. Before turning thirty, I never truly wanted (or felt motivated) to go abroad. I still remember ten years ago, drinking late into the night with Mark and Joey outside Tsinghua’s north gate, declaring that my roots were in China. It feels like yesterday. But now, past thirty, I’ve re-examined life through a more essential lens and realized that many of my attachments were baseless.*

*If I oppose defining and treating people based on innate characteristics like birth origin, then I must equally oppose the household registration system, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, filial piety dogma, nepotism and favor-based society, crony capitalism, nationalism, patriotism... because all of these discriminate based on the accidents of one’s birth. As a line from Sense8 that deeply resonates with me puts it:*

He’s my brother. And not by something as accidental as blood...by something much stronger. By choice.

*Within the four seas, all are brothers—regardless of East or West.*

*If none of these should serve as criteria for dividing humanity, then what principles should we uphold?*

## **Part Five: On Principles****Western elites work to better nurture their families; some mainland Chinese elites, however, make their families serve their work. Remember: superior species are those most successful at raising offspring. Of course, the essence of raising children is for the community, not for oneself—so it’s also fine not to have children, as long as you help close friends in your community better raise theirs.**

**Nature and evolution don’t favor the clever or the wealthy—but they do favor those who contribute to their community. Natural selection is group selection, not individual selection. I wish all my Western-oriented friends on Zhihu happy families and children to be proud of, contributing noble souls to the ideal society of the future.**

神胖胖的文章，常读常新，下面引用注解以分享之。

### **一、关于人生****人生太短，切不可玩曲线救国式的策略。**

**你要当银行家，就去学金融，别想学理化然后转行。你要在美国开拓事业，就去美国干，别整天在中国大陆处于一种正在准备的状态。我人生经历冷暖，终于悟得，其实就算看起来很难的事业，直接去做，在“做”中学，也比你不做光“准备”容易得多。**

**要完成一个理想，你就要做好牺牲此外你拥有的一切的准备去奋斗，只有这样才多少有可能办成。**

这一段胖胖已经说的足够好，我没什么再要注解的了。如果非要说些什么，那就是我觉得对于没有王位要继承的普通人而言，能发现真实的自我，认识到自己的本性和自己真实的目标，以及自己真正的热情所在，并直奔主题的努力奋斗，比学一些不知所谓的套路谋略重要多了。总是羞于承认自己的目标，好像有黑暗森林一样，一旦暴露自己的目标就会招致不必要的打击，什么木秀于林风必摧之，什么枪打出头鸟……那只能说你给别人赋予了太多他们不应得的重要性和注意力。对我而言，我的人生经历也告诉我，走直线就是最短的。

### **二、关于朋友****人生最宝贵的财富就是朋友，其次是时间。朋友和时间都比金钱宝贵。**

**结交深深欣赏自己，同时又是人品端正志同道合的一批朋友，人生简直像穿elite毕业装排随机碾压noobs一样爽。**

**交际能力的核心是快速准确判断对方对你的兴趣水平的能力。**

**不要和不喜欢你的人交朋友。受朋友鼓励是人生可贵的动力之一。和不喜欢你的人在一起，他们天天批评你这也不是那也不是，最后你就会成为一个“不是”的人。**

**当你交上几个欣赏你的好朋友以后，看饭桌上你是不是突然变得活跃、跟你之前害羞、内向的性格相比好像变了一个人一样**(suddenly become alive and get out of your shell of being shy and passive)？

**对于每个朋友，两周出来一次是合理的频率。那些拒绝你的，哪怕是一次，就是不欣赏你的，你应该敬而远之。拒绝这种行为，是所有民族、所有类型的人共同的对他人厌恶的表达，不因背景不同而变化。**

关于朋友，胖胖也说的足够好，我说不出更好的观点和注释。只能反省自己，过去对于朋友的重视还做得远远不够。

### **三、关于人品****对于人品不好的人，再欣赏他的长处也要管住自己敬而远之。**

**最幸福的家庭是父母恩爱，而恩爱的父母都能身体力行地给子女做出榜样，让他们懂得自信、诚实、纪律、镇定和分享的，而不是能赚很多钱让子女在小朋友面前感到很风光的。**

我也常常想，所谓中华民族传统美德的，还有多少适合现代社会。

我的德语课老师提了个“和谐”，这显然是胡话。我在胡温年代刚提出和谐社会时也觉得是个好词，什么“天人合一”，什么“世界大同”…但是后来都知道了，和谐成了手段而非结果，那我就fuck了这狗日的和谐。我宁可他们严刑峻法用法治规则来教化人，也不要这狗逼的和谐来和稀泥；宁可新闻和言论自由来昭彰丑恶，也不要闭目塞听地粉饰太平。因为前者是社会系统改良的正路，后者不说也罢。

关于谦虚。每次提到这个词，我就想起刚毕业时和一个国企大领导的司机的对话，那种挖空心思去找你身上是不是有一丁点儿骄傲的套路把我恶心坏了，大概是我身上确实还有棱角，而且不仅没被磨圆，反而过了三十岁破罐子破摔不要脸了以后，我反而又变回了个愤青。这种美德就留给认为这是美德的人吧，因为这明显是增加沟通成本的行为。大家都这么忙，谁有空慢慢挖掘你身上的闪光点。如果确有必要谦虚一下，那也是为了照顾朋友的心情。

关于人情社会，类似的，增加社会整体交易成本的习惯。它存在的必要性在于社会保障体系的不健全和公共服务的黑箱现状。在一个更健全的社会体里，必要性会大大降低。

关于品德修养，目前就以胖胖列的几点做参考：

自信-不多说了。

诚实-活的年纪越大，我反而越来越反感套路和假话，虽然出生在河南反而越来越不喜欢跟河南人打交道（无关地域歧视，只是这个文化呀，真的是一言难尽，有些地方的文化那就真的是崇尚以诈到人为乐）。今后务以诚实守信为原则。做个像灭霸一样硬核的人。(He) is many things, a liar is not one of them.

纪律-自律，严于律己，宽以待人。

镇定-古话已经说得很多了。猝然临之而不惊，无故加之而不怒。冷淡面对嘲讽和质疑。这个真的是修养功夫，还要向mark同学多学习。

分享-保持一个开放的OPEN-MIND，不自闭。敝帚自珍这种东西对我来说不存在的，学生时代我就不是那种怕分享学习方法的人。对我而言，要特别注意的是要think aloud, 把自己的想法表达分享出来。

**选手下的人，人品是第一位的，忠诚是第二位的，能力是第三位的。**

**选年轻人我喜欢选偏激的人，尤其是那些看起来会成为有远见卓识领袖的偏激的人。**

**不偏激的人，一定不会是有远见的人。**

**当然，偏激的人也不都是有远见的人。**

有些话真的是，有人替你说出来，听了你就知道他说的是对的。信可知，吾道不孤。我一直以来，从中学时代，就因为偏激饱受诟病。因为社会主流推崇那种四平八稳的调调。

当然这也反映了自己信仰不坚，对自己的判断没有信心。但是对于缺少阅历的年轻人来说，又没有大数据验证，我怎么知道自己是对的。

反过来，这又体现出了教育的弊端。引出胖胖的另一句话：

**如果你本事比父母强，就离他们远点，别受干扰。我阅了为数不少平庸家庭里出来的人才，就是因为跟父母相处太多，慢慢又变回平庸了。**

### **四、关于出国****出国别跟中国人混。**

**很多人喜欢抱怨在美国受白人歧视，潜在的标准是说白人不受白人歧视。这是没有道理的，因为如果你生下来不是白人，你就不能（至少是用比较小的代价）变成白人。作为一个命苦的人中国人，我在哪里都要受到歧视。相比在中国大陆受中国同胞歧视，我宁肯在美国受白人歧视。前者是给他们做驴马一类的畜生，后者是给他们做猫狗一类的宠物，显然后者好受些。**

**……尤其是对于我这样一个从来没想过要出国的人（我年轻时是鄙视出国的人的。抛下亲朋好友这是多么自私的表现），命运竟然选择了让我在新大陆获得了新生。**

**世界上的事情，无论我多大本事，有许多像生老病死和自然、社会的动向其实是我控制不了的……**

胖胖这些话，对于我这样一个生长于中国河南农村这样鄙视链最下游的country mouse来说，真是道出了心声。年轻的时候以为自己是坂本龙马，立志于扎根母国，激荡风云，改良社会。三十岁前从未想过（或说真的有动力）要出国。尤记得十年前和Mark, Joey在清华北门喝酒宵夜，我说自己根在中国。仿如昨日。而今过了三十岁以后，我用更本质的眼光重新审视生活，发现很多执念是没有道理的。

如果我反对以出身这样先天的东西来定义人，来区别对待人，那我同样的就应该反对户籍制度、反对性别歧视、反对种族歧视、反对孝道、反对亲戚/裙带/人情社会、反对权贵资本主义、反对民族主义、反对爱国主义……因为所有这些，都是以人先天的出身来差别对待人。正如Sense8里一句我深深认同的台词：

He's my brother. And not by something as accidental as blood...by something much stronger. By choice.

四海之内皆兄弟，无问西东。

如果所有这些都不应该构成划分人群的标准，那么什么才应该是我们秉持的理念呢？

### **五、关于理念****西方精英工作是为了更好地哺育家庭，中国大陆有些精英的家庭却是为工作服务的。要知道，优胜的物种，都是在哺育后代上最成功的物种。当然，哺育孩子的本质是为社群，不是为自己，所以不要孩子也可以，那就帮助社群的挚友使其能更好地哺育他们的孩子。**

**大自然和进化论并不偏爱聪明的人和富裕的人，不过他们的确偏爱能够为社群做出贡献的人。自然选择是群体选择(group selection)而不是个体选择(individual selection)。我祝愿各种亲西方的知友都能有幸福的家庭和令人骄傲的子女，为未来的理想社会贡献人类的崇高灵魂。**
