I’ve been reading Taleb’s *Skin in the Game* these past few days. The book primarily explores the concept of asymmetric risk—the central idea being that if there’s any chance of total ruin, you shouldn’t touch it no matter how great the potential gains. Repeatedly exposing yourself to risk, however small the probability, will eventually destroy you.

But what truly lingers with me is his moral insight and call to action: **Be entrepreneurs.** Courage is the highest virtue, and the essence of courage is taking on risk—sacrificing your own well-being for the sake of something greater than yourself. This suddenly connected a whole series of scattered thoughts I’d been having lately.

## **The Existential Problem**Existentialism teaches us to engage with life. But what does that actually mean? As someone who’s never believed in hedonism, I’ve never gotten the appeal of beach vacations. Or those little everyday pleasures? They don’t ignite my passion either. Looking back, what I’ve truly enjoyed has always been non-material.

Taleb’s “skin in the game” suddenly hit me. Always doing things that carry no risk—like endlessly thinking and running simulations in my head—gradually made me lose touch with reality, eventually trapping me in a nihilistic void about existence and meaning.

## **Practice Over Theory**We often think knowledge is invented by university scholars, but it’s actually craftsmen and practitioners who develop it through hands-on practice. The answers to life and the formation of self-identity work the same way.

Universality is grand in books but disastrous in practice. Kant’s moral metaphysics—both the principle of universality and treating people as ends—is excellent, and I would never say it’s wrong. But in practice, it’s extremely difficult to apply. Kant’s principles typically require second-order or higher abstraction, yet 95% of people don’t even possess the capacity for second-order thinking—they simply cannot grasp abstractions even one level higher. Systems that work well tend to be more localized, like Anglo-American common law compared to continental legal systems. These systems aren’t so much designed as experimented into being.

I once considered an academic path, but always felt fundamentally at odds with academia. The experiments and hypotheses didn’t seem to contain the answers I was seeking. So hearing Taleb talk about skin in the game resonated deeply with me. This is the path we need to take, and it’s at the heart of the existential problem that’s been troubling me lately.

## **Soul in the Game**Safe imagination and simulation purely in your head can’t produce any meaningful answers. We need skin in the game. Even more so, we need **soul in the game.**

Investing your life’s time and energy in what matters most to you—things whose loss you’d deeply regret and whose attainment would bring genuine joy—that’s the path to breaking through nihilism.

**We need entrepreneurs.**

## **Creation Over Destruction**A while back, when I wasn’t focusing on work, I reread the *Vagabond* manga. Then I saw a comment on Reddit that hit home:

Killing is so easy, yet bringing forth even a thread of life is so difficult; destruction happens in an instant, but creation is long and arduous.

Those simple moral commandments usually oversimplify everything—right and wrong, black and white. To understand the true meaning of morality, we need the capacity to understand complex systems and find pathways that actually work.

Why bother with thankless tasks? Maybe because I find life boring and think about death every day—if I don’t do something mentally demanding, I simply can’t go on living. Maybe it’s about aesthetics. Should we live in accordance with nature or against it? Drifting along and enjoying the moment versus diligence and discipline—people choose both, and the key is finding beauty and tranquility in whichever you choose. Some things just feel too cheap to me.

In my understanding, what entrepreneurs create isn’t just concrete things—**human connection is equally part of it.**

## **The Courage to Build**I rarely see forgiveness in Chinese people—another rare quality is integrity. Friendships fall apart at the drop of a hat but rarely mend. It’s so easy for people to hate each other, but loving others requires courage, patience, and skill.

To fight atomization, to fight nihilism, what we desperately need is cohesion. If you only know how to destroy but can’t build something better, you’ll never truly convince anyone. I’m not against criticism, but stopping at that level is just too cheap.

Skin in the game also means not wasting resources and energy on things you don’t truly want. I’ve been quite confused and lost lately, feeling empty about everything, unsure what I want next. But this book reminded me that there are still things that can ignite our passion, things that lift us up.

Going forward, I should put my soul in such games.

这几天读了塔勒布的Skin in the Game，书里主要讲解了非对称风险的概念，比方说如果存在爆仓的风险，那么无论收益再大都不该碰。反复将自己暴露在风险中，无论多小的概率，最终都会死。

但最让我念念不忘的是他关于道德的洞见和倡议：做企业家 (Be entrepreneurs). 勇气是最高的美德，勇气的本质就是承担风险，为更高的价值牺牲自我。这就一下子把我最近的一系列散乱想法都串了起来。

存在主义教导我们要投入生活。但怎样做才算投入生活？像我这样一个一贯不信奉享乐的人，怎么都get不到海滨沙滩的乐趣。或者日常生活的小确幸？也不怎么能唤起我的热情。回想起来，我真正享受的，都是那些非物质的东西。

塔勒布的skin in the game猛然点醒了我。总是做那些不承担风险的事（比如一味思考在脑子里推演一切），让我慢慢丧失对现实的触感，最终陷入对存在和意义的虚无。

我们总以为知识是大学学者发明创造出来的，其实是能工巧匠在实践中摸索出来的。人生的答案和自我身份的认同也是一样。普世性只在书本上伟大，但在实践中却是灾难。康德的道德形而上学，无论是普世性原则还是以人为目的，这些都是极好的，我永远不会说他们是错的，但在实践中却极难应用。康德的那些原则通常是要二阶以上的抽象，而95%的人甚至都不具备二阶思维的能力，死活都理解不了哪怕高一个层阶的抽象。运作良好的体系是那些更加本地化的，比如英美的普通法体系之于大陆法系。这些体系与其说是设计出来的，不如说是试验出来的。

我曾考虑学术道路，但总感觉和学术圈貌合神离，感觉在实验和假设当中并没有我所寻求的答案。所以听到Taleb说skin in the game，感觉很有共鸣。这才是我们要走的路，也是最近困扰我的所谓存在问题的症结所在。

只在脑子里做安全的想象和推演并不能得出任何有意义的答案。我们需要skin in the game, 更甚而地，soul in the game.

把生命的时间和精力投注在对自己而言最重要的、失之会深感遗憾而得之会满心喜悦的事上，这才是破除虚无的路径。

我们需要企业家 entrepreneurs.

前一段无心正事，又把《浪客行》漫画看了一遍。然后在reddit上看到一条评论很是切题：杀戮如此轻易，哪如孕育一丝生命那般艰难；毁灭不过一瞬，创造却是漫长而艰辛。

那些简单的道德戒律通常都把事情太简化了，是与非，黑与白。要理解道德的真义，需要我们有能力去理解复杂系统，找到行之有效的方法路径。

为啥非要去做那些费力又不讨好的事？或许是因为我觉得人生无聊每天都想死，不干点费神儿的事简直活不下去。或许是因为美感。人活在世上到底是要顺应自然还是要违背自然？混吃等死及时行乐还是勤奋自律循规蹈距，怎么选的人都有，关键是自己从里面发现美和宁静。有些事我就是觉得太廉价了。

在我理解里，企业家(entrepreneur)造的也不只有具体实物，人和人的连结也是题中之义。

我在（中国）人身上很少看到宽恕这种品质（另一种是正直）。友谊的小船说翻就翻，但却极少有能重圆的。人和人相互憎恨太容易了，但要爱人却需要勇气、耐心和技艺。要对抗原子化，对抗虚无，我们更稀缺更需要的是凝结。若一味只知破坏，却无力建设一个更好的出来，终究难以让人信服。我不反对批评，但若只停留在那一层面就太cheap了。

Skin in the Game还意味着不要把资源和精力浪费在自己不渴望的事情上。我最近很是纠结彷徨，四大皆空，不知道接下来想要什么。但这本书提醒了我，还是有些东西能够唤起我们的生命热情，使人昂扬，接下来应该 put my soul in such games.
