Kant stands as the most profound thinker I have ever encountered. His Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals had a deep impact on my moral framework, guiding me to organize my scattered thoughts into a systematic approach to ethical questions.

Beyond this work, his other writings are also filled with insights. For instance, Perpetual Peace profoundly shaped my views on geopolitics and the future of the world, making it seem as if the last two centuries of history were simply a commentary on his vision. Similarly, ideas from Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime frequently come to mind, whether in discussions of aesthetics or gender dynamics.

In a world saturated with picturesque social media posts, it is easy to feel a sense of emptiness. I believe that exploring the peaks of thought is as essential as experiencing the wonders of the physical world.

Kant is an inescapable presence on this intellectual journey. He represents a pivotal turning point in the history of thought, initiating a Copernican revolution in philosophy that redefined how we understand knowledge and existence. His influence has shaped and inspired generations of philosophers who followed in his footsteps. Without engaging with Kant's ideas, one remains merely on the threshold of philosophy, never truly entering its depths.

It's no surprise that many young people today, whether in China or Europe, dismiss philosophy with a touch of cynicism. They often lack the life experience needed to grasp its deeper meaning. Philosophy—especially moral philosophy—is not just an abstract exercise; it forms the bedrock of society and infuses life with meaning. If you don’t perceive its impact, it is only because its principles are so deeply embedded in our thinking that they seem self-evident, beyond question.

Reading Kant is not easy. Honestly, I could not have imagined understanding his work a decade ago. Before Kant, philosophical texts might have been a casual read, but engaging with his ideas demands true effort. Is it worth the struggle? In my experience, the answer is a resounding yes. Investing time in these classics far surpasses the fleeting value of reading a thousand popular books. The effort pays off—it elevates your thinking, broadens your perspective, and brings you closer to the nature of things.

My recommended reading order begins with Kant’s political writings, followed by the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, and then the three Critiques. Next on my list is the Critique of Pure Reason, which I hope to complete within the year.

康德是我所知道的思想最深刻的作者了。他的《道德形而上学奠基》深刻地影响我的道德体系，帮我梳理了自己过往零碎的思想碎片，形成了在道德问题上成体系的分析框架和指南。

读过的其他作品也无不充满洞见，比如《论永久和平》影响我的地缘政治和世界未来的看法，仿佛过去二百年的世界史都在为此注解一般；《论优美和崇高》里的话也时不时让我想起，不管是事关美学还是男女问题，尽管其中有些观点放在今天有些政治不正确了，可事实又一再证明他的洞见。

我看过这么多美轮美奂的朋友圈和story，看得多了有时不免感觉空洞。我相信与看遍世间风景同样重要的是探索那深植于我们内心深处的思想高峰。

而想要攀登思想的高峰，康德是绕不过去的存在。他是思想史上的分水岭，哲学史上哥白尼式的革命，重塑了我们对知识和存在的理解。他的思想影响和启发了他之后的一众哲学家，不读康德就如同永远止步在哲学的门外一般。

说起哲学，似乎全世界的年轻人都难掩嘲讽，不管是在中国，还是在欧洲。这完全可以理解，年轻人还缺少社会经验和人生经历，不能领会哲学的深层意义。没有经历过严重思想冲突和精神痛苦的人，怎么能理解道德的份量？（道德）哲学建构了社会，赋予你生存的意义。如果你感受不到它起作用，那只是因为它通过语言的媒介潜移默化地种在了你的内心，以至于他显得如此理所当然，从来没在你心里升起疑问。

要读他的著作并不容易。其实我也很难想象倒退十年，我当真能读懂。康德以前的哲学著作你还可以闲庭信步般当作娱乐读物消遣，但自他开始不经过艰苦的努力几乎难以入门。

那还值得花这么多力气去做吗？我不能为每个人保证，但以我的经验来看，花时间去读这些经典，胜过读一千本通俗读物。所有这些艰苦的努力，他们最终提升了你的思想境界，开拓了你的视野，使你得以触摸事物的本质。

我的阅读顺序是：政治著作, 道德形而上学奠基, 三大批判。
接下来阅读《纯粹理性批判》。希望一年可以读完。
