Kant stands as the most profound thinker I have ever encountered. His *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* had a deep impact on my moral framework, guiding me to organize my scattered thoughts into a systematic approach to ethical questions.

## The Breadth of Kant's Influence

Beyond this foundational work, his other writings are also filled with insights. For instance, *Perpetual Peace* profoundly shaped my views on geopolitics and the future of the world, making it seem as if the last two centuries of history were simply a commentary on his vision. Similarly, ideas from *Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime* frequently come to mind, whether in discussions of aesthetics or gender dynamics.

> "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence... the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me." — Immanuel Kant

## The Essential Journey of Thought

In a world saturated with picturesque social media posts, it is easy to feel a sense of emptiness. I believe that exploring the peaks of thought is as essential as experiencing the wonders of the physical world.

Kant is an inescapable presence on this intellectual journey. He represents a pivotal turning point in the history of thought, initiating a **Copernican revolution** in philosophy that redefined how we understand knowledge and existence. His influence has shaped and inspired generations of philosophers who followed in his footsteps. Without engaging with Kant's ideas, one remains merely on the threshold of philosophy, never truly entering its depths.

## Philosophy and Modern Life

It's no surprise that many young people today, whether in China or Europe, dismiss philosophy with a touch of cynicism. They often lack the life experience needed to grasp its deeper meaning. Philosophy—especially moral philosophy—is not just an abstract exercise; it forms the bedrock of society and infuses life with meaning. If you don't perceive its impact, it is only because its principles are so deeply embedded in our thinking that they seem self-evident, beyond question.

## The Challenge and Reward

Reading Kant is not easy. Honestly, I could not have imagined understanding his work a decade ago. Before Kant, philosophical texts might have been a casual read, but engaging with his ideas demands true effort. Is it worth the struggle? In my experience, the answer is a resounding **yes**.

Investing time in these classics far surpasses the fleeting value of reading a thousand popular books. The effort pays off in multiple ways:

- It elevates your thinking
- It broadens your perspective
- It brings you closer to the nature of things
- It provides a framework for understanding modern ethical debates

## A Recommended Reading Path

My recommended reading order for approaching Kant:

1. **Political Writings** — Start with his more accessible works on politics and society
2. **Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals** — Essential for understanding his ethical framework
3. **The Three Critiques:**
   - *Critique of Pure Reason* — The foundation of his epistemology
   - *Critique of Practical Reason* — His moral philosophy expanded
   - *Critique of Judgment* — Aesthetics and teleology

Next on my list is the *Critique of Pure Reason*, which I hope to complete within the year.

*Reading philosophy is not about collecting ideas, but about transforming how we think. Kant offers us not just theories, but a new way of seeing the world and our place in it.*
