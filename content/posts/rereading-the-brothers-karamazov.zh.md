I recently listened to *The Brothers Karamazov* as an audiobook. Back in the day (during the Zhengzhou floods), it took me months to finish reading it; this time I got through it in just a few days.

Funny how when you’re supposed to be doing real work, even massive tomes become entertainment. To avoid actual work, I could even force myself through a few pages of the *Critique of Pure Reason*.

I’ve always been hesitant to write about this book. As the culmination of Dostoevsky’s lifetime of thought, I doubt my ability to grasp its full depth.

Even today, I can only approach it from the details, jotting down scattered personal reflections.

What shocked me about *The Brothers Karamazov* back then was precisely that I was deeply troubled by questions of meaning and nihilism.

Just like Ivan’s declaration in the book that “everything is permitted,” I too believed at the time that good and evil were human constructs.

But the book uses a patricide case to show us the bloody consequences of nihilism, reminding us that morality is not entirely man-made after all—it’s neither relative nor void.

Ivan renounced his God, unable to accept the innocent suffering of children, wanting to return his ticket to eternal harmony.

And I too had shaken my long-held faith in humanity, unable to accept that a position of freedom could stand against everyone else.

Initially, I just wanted to find a framework to resolve questions of right and wrong sparked by the intense conflicts around the Hong Kong events.

That’s when I discovered an entire field of study: ethics, also known as moral philosophy.

My understanding of morality still stems from Kant’s *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals*. The ancient Greeks divided science into three categories: logic, which studies pure form without any material substance; physics, which studies natural phenomena; and ethics, which studies the phenomena of freedom.

In other words, all questions about humanity fall into the moral domain.

In my currently muddled brain, moral questions have broad implications: ultimate faith, the meaning of life, universal values, standards of good and evil, the ideal world, the foundation and principles for living, human dignity...

Morality is ultimately not void. Regardless of what it’s rooted in, while it is indeed constructed by humans, the reasons behind it aren’t arbitrary but deeply planted in something more fundamental.

What’s frustrating is that while I believe in the existence of objective moral absolute truth, I can’t articulate what it is at all, always doubting what to stand for. Meanwhile, those who verbally deny these things have bodies more honest than their mouths—each one certain and categorical. The contradiction here is: if there’s no absolute truth in the world, what gives you the right to advocate or insist on anything? Your position against absolute truth itself has nothing absolute about it. I understand many people oppose this from a stance of freedom, as if someone even thinking about these universal questions is trying to set rules for others, an offense to their free will. But isn’t the order implied by this idea that everyone is free and equal itself an absolute truth? This is the second-order abstraction of moral questions, what Kant explores in the metaphysics of morals.

I must honestly admit that I am utterly incapable of solving such complex problems. My mind is a Euclidean, earthly mind, so how can I solve problems that are not of this world?

—Ivan Karamazov

Let’s leave these ultimate answers to those who are capable, though I’m skeptically doubtful they can be solved.

As Ivan’s “Grand Inquisitor” parable reveals, humanity’s existential predicament is that no miracle shows you absolute truth, no one can tell you the ultimate mysteries of this world.

Humans seem like “immature experiments created as a joke,” a bunch of weak traitors. Given freedom, you can’t bear its burden at all, always eager to surrender it to some answer, no matter how superficial. Given reason, but incompletely—as Kant criticized in the *Critique of Pure Reason*, reason can never cross the boundary to answer questions about the transcendent world.

Dostoevsky said Ivan is profound—not like contemporary atheists whose lack of faith merely demonstrates narrow worldviews and mediocre, dull intellects.

Ivan’s heart isn’t the tranquility and liberation of unbelief; rather, behind rational disbelief, there’s always an interrogation of doubt about that disbelief.

Though I cannot see the sun, I still know there is a sun. And isn’t knowing there is a sun the entire meaning of life?

—Dmitri Karamazov

The Karamazov family holds deep symbolic meaning. As I understand it, the father represents human primal desires and bodily instincts; the eldest son represents human emotion and passion; the second son Ivan represents human reason and speculation; the third son represents faith and spirituality; the illegitimate son represents the incarnation of evil when reason breaks free from moral constraints.

I naturally empathize most with Ivan. Elder Zosima’s words of comfort to Ivan once comforted me too. He yearns for life but lacks conviction in living. He has major intellectual problems unresolved—he’s the type who needs to solve intellectual problems rather than needing millions. But once upon a time, I was also a Dmitri (the eldest son). I remember when Liu Han said my greatest strength was passion and explosive force—it makes me lament how things have changed. People always miss childhood and youth because they had no intellectual troubles then; the world was simple and black-and-white. But wisdom should liberate people.

Love life, not life’s meaning; love concrete people, not abstract humanity.

This reminds me of Honey in *A Brighter Summer Day*, a gang leader who reads *War and Peace*. He says people from ancient times are really like us. Look—two hundred years have passed, and we’re still troubled by similar problems. And predictably, two hundred years from now, there will still be people worrying just like us.

This is why I say the intellectual gap between *Dream of the Red Chamber* and *The Brothers Karamazov* spans millennia. *Dream* is a portrait of life in clan society. Though three hundred years have passed, I can still empathize—the characters remain vivid as if before my eyes, because I too grew up in a large family and can understand the motives behind every word and action. But where does it have even half of *The Brothers Karamazov*‘s ultimate interrogation, pointing directly at the essence of human existential predicament? When you read the Zen dialogue parts between Jia Baoyu and Xue Baochai/Lin Daiyu in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the deep feeling is of a bunch of middle school kids parroting responses, with the final answer being to become a monk and be done with it. But *The Brothers Karamazov* has both profound rebels like Ivan pointing directly at the problem’s essence, and genuinely attempts through Elder Zosima to solve these existential questions.

My recent hobby is downloading academic papers from CNKI after finishing a book. Douban reviews always seem shallow; it’s more interesting to read analyses people spent years developing. Of course, quality varies—I’ve read some analyses of *The Brothers Karamazov* where master’s theses cobbled together by twenty-something young women are simply unreadable, just piling up flowery language without understanding the deeper meaning. I can’t get through even a little bit.

However, one paper, “Dostoevsky’s Christian Thought Through ‘The Grand Inquisitor,’” contains some lines that resonate with me. I excerpt them here for remembrance of things forgotten:

Where there is guardianship over people, hypocritical concern for their happiness and enjoyment, while simultaneously despising them, not believing in their noble origin and noble mission—there lies the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor.

Where happiness is valued over freedom, the temporary placed above the eternal, loving humanity used to oppose loving God—there lies the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor.

Where it’s emphasized that truth is useless for human happiness, that life can be arranged without understanding life’s meaning—there it lies.

最近把《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》的书听了一遍。想当年（郑州大水那段时间），花了几个月才看完，这几天就听完了。

反正就当你干正事的时候，大部头的书反而成了消遣。为了逃避干活，就连《纯粹理性批判》我都能啃上几页。

这部书我一直不怎么敢动笔去写。本书作为陀翁毕生思想的集大成者，我自问没有能力把握它的全部深度。

即便今日也只能从细处着笔，写一写个人零散的所思所想。

彼时《卡》震撼我之处，正在于我正深自被意义和虚无困扰。

正如书里伊凡宣称一切皆可为的思想一样，其时我也相信善恶都是人造。

而本书就借一桩杀父案把虚无主义的血淋后果展示给我们，提醒我们道德终归并非全然人造，并不相对或是虚无。

伊凡背弃了他的上帝，不能接受孩子们无故遭受的苦难，要把永久和谐的入场券退还。

而我彼时也动摇了自己一贯的对人的信念，不能接受自由的立场竟站在了所有人的对立面。

起初我只是因为香港事件所带来的激烈冲突，想找出一套体系去解决是非对错标准的问题。

进而就发现了这样一整门的学科，即伦理学，也叫道德哲学。

我对道德的理解还是源于康德的《道德形而上学奠基》。古希腊人把科学分为三类，不涉及任何物质实体纯粹研究形式哲学的是逻辑学，研究自然现象的是物理学，研究自由现象的是伦理学。

换言之，一切关于人的问题，都归于道德范畴。

在我现在混沌的脑壳里，道德问题有着广泛的含义：终极的信仰，人生的意义，普世的价值，善恶的标准，理想的世界，安身立命的根基和法则，人的尊严……

道德终究不是虚无，不管它植根于什么，虽然它确实是人为建构的，但它背后的理由却不是任意的，而深植于某些更深层的东西。

恼人的是，我虽然相信着客观道德绝对真理的存在，但却丝毫不能说明白它是什么，总是怀疑着要去坚持什么。而反观那些口头上不承认这些的人，身体却比嘴诚实，一个个的笃定而又言之凿凿。这里的矛盾之处就是，如果世上没有绝对的真理，那你又有什么资格去主张去坚持任何东西？你反对绝对真理的立场本身也毫无绝对之处。我理解很多人是持自由的立场反对，仿佛有旁人哪怕去思考这些普世的问题，都好像在试图为他人设置规则一样，构成了对其自由意志的冒犯。但是这种每个人都自由平等的理念背后所蕴含的秩序本身是不是绝对真理呢？这就是关于道德问题的二阶抽象，康德在道德形而上学里所探讨的东西。

我只好老老实实地承认，我毫无能力解决这样复杂的问题，我的头脑是欧几里得式的世俗的头脑，因此我哪能解决来自非人间的问题呢。

——伊凡·卡拉马佐夫

这些终极的答案还是交给有能力的人吧，但我谨慎怀疑这是否能被解决。

正如伊凡的《宗教大法官》寓言所揭示的一样，人的存在困境就是没有任何神迹向你展示绝对真理，没有人能告诉这世界的的终极奥秘。

人就好像是“为了开开玩笑而创造出来的不成熟的试验品”，是一群软弱无力的叛徒。给了你自由，但你丝毫不能承担自由的负担，总是急于把它献给某一个答案，不管它多肤浅。给了你理性，但又不完全，正像康德在《纯粹理性批判》所批判的，理性永远不能越过边界去回答那些超验世界的问题。

陀翁说，伊万是深刻的，这不是当代的无神论者，他们的无信仰只说明世界观的狭隘和才智的平庸呆板。

伊凡的内心不是无信仰的宁静与解脱，而是相反，在不信的理性背后，却总有对不信的怀疑的审问。

纵然看不见太阳，我仍然知道有太阳。而知道有太阳—不正是生命的全部意义所在吗？

——德米特里·卡拉马佐夫

卡拉马佐夫一家有着深刻的象征意义，以我理解，父亲代表人的原始欲望和肉体本能，长子代表人的情感和激情，次子伊凡代表人的理性和思辨，三子代表信仰和灵性，私生子则代表理性脱离道德约束后的恶之化身。

我最能共情的当然是伊凡，长老佐西玛宽慰伊凡的话当年也曾宽慰了我。他渴望生活，却缺乏生活的信念。他有重大的思想问题没能解决，是那种不需要百万家私而需要解决思想问题的那种人。但曾几何时我也是一只德米特里（长子），想起当年刘涵说我身上最大的优点是激情和爆发力，不由让我感慨物是人非。人总怀念童年少年时，因为那时他们还没有思想上的困扰，世界是简单和黑白分明的。但智慧应当解脱人。

爱生活，而非生活的意义；爱具体的人，而不是抽象的人。

不由想起《牯岭街少年杀人事件》里的哈尼，一个看《战争与和平》的帮派领袖。他说古时候的人和我们真的很像。你看二百年过去了，我们还是被相似的问题困扰。而可以想见的是，再过二百年，也还是有后来人和我们一样烦恼。

这也是为什么我说，《红楼梦》和《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》之间的思想境界相差千年。《红》是一本宗族社会里的浮世图景，虽说时过三百年我也能感同身受，人物仍然活灵活现仿若眼前，因为我也在大家庭里长大很能理解人物一言一行的背后动机。但是它哪有半分像《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》这样的终极拷问，直指人的存在困境本质。你读《红楼梦》里贾宝玉和薛林对禅机的部分，一个深切的感受就是一帮初中生小屁孩在那里鹦鹉学舌顺嘴对答，最后的答案就是出家了事。而《卡》则既有伊凡这样思想深刻的反叛之人去直指问题的本质，又实实在在地借佐西玛长老之口尝试去解决这些有关存在的问题。

我最近一个爱好是看完一本书以后去知网上下载论文来看，豆瓣的书评总觉得浅，还是看一些别人花了几年时间深度解读的东西有意思一些。当然也良莠不齐，比如我看了一些解读《卡》的，那些二十来岁小姑娘拼凑出来的硕士论文简直不忍卒读，除了堆砌词藻完全不解其中深意，看一点儿就看不下去。

不过其中有一篇《从看陀思妥耶夫斯基的基督思想》里，一些话还是合我意的，摘在这里为了那些忘却的记念：

哪里有对人的监护，对他们幸福和享受的虚伪关心，同时又蔑视他们，不相信他们的崇高起源和崇高使命，哪里就有宗教大法官的精神。

哪里视幸福高于自由，将暂时置于永恒之上，以爱人来反对爱上帝，哪里有就有宗教大法官的精神。

哪里强调真理对于人的幸福无用，不了解生命的意义就可以安排好生活，哪里就有它。
