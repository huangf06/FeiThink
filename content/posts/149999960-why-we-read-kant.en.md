# Why We Read Kant


Kant stands as the most profound thinker I have ever encountered. His Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals had a deep impact on my moral framework, guiding me to organize my scattered thoughts into a systematic approach to ethical questions.

Beyond this work, his other writings are also filled with insights. For instance, Perpetual Peace profoundly shaped my views on geopolitics and the future of the world, making it seem as if the last two centuries of history were simply a commentary on his vision. Similarly, ideas from Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime frequently come to mind, whether in discussions of aesthetics or gender dynamics.

In a world saturated with picturesque social media posts, it is easy to feel a sense of emptiness. I believe that exploring the peaks of thought is as essential as experiencing the wonders of the physical world.

Kant is an inescapable presence on this intellectual journey. He represents a pivotal turning point in the history of thought, initiating a Copernican revolution in philosophy that redefined how we understand knowledge and existence. His influence has shaped and inspired generations of philosophers who followed in his footsteps. Without engaging with Kant's ideas, one remains merely on the threshold of philosophy, never truly entering its depths.

It's no surprise that many young people today, whether in China or Europe, dismiss philosophy with a touch of cynicism. They often lack the life experience needed to grasp its deeper meaning. Philosophy—especially moral philosophy—is not just an abstract exercise; it forms the bedrock of society and infuses life with meaning. If you don’t perceive its impact, it is only because its principles are so deeply embedded in our thinking that they seem self-evident, beyond question.

Reading Kant is not easy. Honestly, I could not have imagined understanding his work a decade ago. Before Kant, philosophical texts might have been a casual read, but engaging with his ideas demands true effort. Is it worth the struggle? In my experience, the answer is a resounding yes. Investing time in these classics far surpasses the fleeting value of reading a thousand popular books. The effort pays off—it elevates your thinking, broadens your perspective, and brings you closer to the nature of things.

My recommended reading order begins with Kant’s political writings, followed by the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, and then the three Critiques. Next on my list is the Critique of Pure Reason, which I hope to complete within the year.
