Last night I watched the episode of *Thirteen Invitations* where Xu Zhiyuan interviewed Luo Xiang on YouTube. I’d stumbled across someone on Twitter claiming that Luo’s intellectual depth in this episode was ten times greater than Xu’s, so I was curious to see what they meant by “greater.” Whether it’s ten times or not is hard to say, but watching it, the gap was indeed striking. Especially when Xu brought up the term “pan-moralization”—at that moment, I felt deep sympathy for Professor Luo. It was as if he were conversing with someone illiterate in moral philosophy. The so-called “pan-moralization” in China isn’t the proliferation of morality, but the proliferation of pseudo-morality. What true morality actually is rarely gets discussed publicly—it’s not allowed to be discussed. The moment Xu uttered this term, his lack of learning was exposed; his understanding remains at the most superficial level of the ordinary person. That’s why Luo paused for a moment before patiently explaining the basic concepts.

Then this morning, articles started popping up saying Luo Xiang had “overturned” (gotten himself canceled). I wondered what had happened—was I being targeted by algorithms? Upon checking, I found that Professor Luo was being attacked again for a new video on Bilibili criticizing nationalism. What a coincidence.

Among all Chinese speakers who have spoken publicly, whether at home or abroad, Luo Xiang is one of the few who meets my standards. The rest are largely mediocre and not worth mentioning.

As for those who style themselves as literati and celebrities—the likes of Gao Xiaosong and Xu Zhiyuan—I generally have little regard for them. They may have read many books, but their intellectual depth is shallow. As intellectuals who don’t pursue truth and genuine knowledge as their goal, they’re like pirates in the world of *One Piece* who don’t aspire to become the Pirate King—what’s the difference between them and salted fish? China’s three thousand years of intellectual and cultural achievements, compared to today’s global intellectual peaks, is roughly the distance from ankle to crown. Those who still worship traditional Chinese learning or the literati ideal might as well be called foot fetishists. That’s why I have zero interest in Confucian classics, scholar ideals, or literati romance. It’s somewhat excusable for twenty-somethings to appreciate such things, but for people in their forties or fifties to remain at this level is simply unacceptable. As for public figures with journalism backgrounds, in a word: poor thinking ability, as evidenced by jokes like Cui Yongyuan’s anti-GMO campaign or Chai Jing’s interview with Ding Zhongli. And overseas democracy activists? A mixed bag. To sum them up with my assessment of Ai Weiwei from last year: “Who gives a fuck.” The older generation of democracy activists generally lacks competence—many make noise, but few have genuine insight. They’re just remnants blessed by historical circumstance. Those with both ability and character are even rarer.

Back to the incident itself. Why is nationalism wrong?

Moral questions are never simple. Moral philosophy is a profound discipline.

Is nationalism good? In some sense, yes—if it helps strengthen mutual trust and aid within your group, it has positive significance. But is it the ultimate standard for judging everything? Obviously not. Just shift your perspective slightly: imagine you’re from one of the small nations historically destroyed by China. Would you still support Han nationalism? Using Country X’s sword to claim land for Country X’s plow—isn’t that Nazi Germany? From another nation’s perspective, it becomes a moving anthem of resistance against invasion.

Morality and justice have levels and magnitudes. Sacrificing for a lover, taking a knife for a friend, bringing glory to the family name, giving one’s life for country and people, protecting world peace, dedicating one’s life without complaint to strangers on distant continents... Which of these do you think is most just and glorious?

Do you think I want you to choose the last one? Because it shows the greatest love, the most selfless altruism?

Wrong! If a moral requirement strays so far from human nature that only saints can achieve it, then it has no universal significance. You can practice it yourself, but you can’t demand it of others. What morality has universal significance? For example, don’t kill people randomly, otherwise we’ll all be gone eventually. These are also generally called laws.

So which of the above is most just? I think they’re all equal, with no hierarchy, and can perfectly coexist. You sacrifice selflessly for your lover, I take a knife for my friend, they serve country and people with distinction—we all have bright futures. When they conflict, that’s the trolley problem—there’s no definitive answer, but the common practice is still to save more people.

What’s most immoral, what I see as pure evil, is actually people’s desire to force their will upon others. Viewing others purely as tools to implement your own will, rather than seeing them as people with free will like yourself.

Narrow nationalism and racism share the same spiritual core. Both view people as tools and mechanical products, attempting to use someone’s origin to deny their free will and impose your beliefs upon them.

So-called “traitor” or “sellout” aren’t necessarily insults. By this logic, Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during WWII, would be a genuine German traitor. Similarly, if a Chinese person upholds their beliefs and fights their compatriots without hesitation when China invades another country, I couldn’t call them a traitor—I’d have to respect them as having real backbone.

So nation, race, and origin don’t constitute ultimate standards for moral judgment. The ultimate standard for moral judgment is the good will behind people’s choices.

And this is often known only to heaven. “Duke of Zhou feared rumors in his day; Wang Mang was humble before usurping.” So don’t judge individuals lightly unless they’re important to you. Focus your magnifying glass on matters that concern everyone.

What I particularly admire about Luo Xiang is that he continues to shine bit by bit, illuminating more people even in China’s current high-pressure environment. In this so-called “controversy,” despite countless people cursing him, he’s also won support from many. Things aren’t as monolithic as they were a few years ago. Through his actions, he proves that humanity and reason can dispel darkness, which I find very heartening.

Morality is extremely difficult to change. In a sense, morality is a type of emotion—once these neural pathways are established, changing them is incredibly hard. Imagine the difficulty of persuading elderly relatives to change their views. That classmate who memorized Mao’s poetry with us in our high school dorm is still a “patriot” with the five-starred red flag as their avatar, like many of my high school classmates—their patriotic sentiment hasn’t changed much over the years. I don’t criticize this simple emotion; I just wish for a bit more brain power. Before blocking your top-student classmate who’s been abroad for years, couldn’t you consider them as someone with reason and conscience like yourself? Maybe they have better reasons than you? That said, isn’t my own character—disdaining authority, refusing blind obedience, stubbornly insisting on principles—also a kind of moral conviction that hasn’t changed one bit over the years? So when I heard Dashu still using my high school reputation of being “extreme,” it felt both familiar and strange.

Looking at the many places I’ve been, my hometown probably counts as a moral lowland. I used to say Nanyang was relatively good within Henan, but after the music festival incident, I can’t say that anymore. What was then called “extreme” now seems like resistance after being bullied by lowland morality without being able to articulate why. Like when history or politics textbooks force you to believe nonsensical theories, like my argument “everyone is selfish therefore no one can be selfish” resisting collectivism, like the tyranny of forcing humility on you regardless of your actual situation and punishing you if you resist. What feels strange is that after all these years, as times change and circumstances shift, I gradually understand various causes and effects. Even if my current views don’t align with the mainstream, I have more reasons to believe I stand on the side of reason. Those on the opposite side seem more driven by (moral) emotions, more “extreme.”

Of course, if you say I won the debate but lost at life, I have no comeback. Whose life isn’t a failure that eventually arrives? Life is vast as the sea, mountain after mountain and river after river, nothing more than this. Living life in the way you prefer—that’s the morality of life.

昨晚刚在油管上看了许知远采访罗翔的那期十三邀，因为偶然在推上看到有人评说看这一期罗展现的思想层次比许高十倍，我就想去看下怎么个高法。十倍不十倍不好说，但我看了确实感觉高下立判。特别是当许提及「泛道德化」这个词的时候，那一刻我特别同情罗老师，感觉他仿佛是在和文盲（特指道德哲学领域）对话一样。所谓「泛道德化」在中国的现状，不是道德的泛化，而是伪道德的泛化，真正的道德是什么极少被公开讨论，不允许讨论。许这个词一出口就看出不学无术，在这方面还是普通人最狭义上的理解，所以罗翔愣了一会儿，才先给他做基本概念上的科普。

然后今天早上就有文章推送说罗翔翻车。我还以为这是怎么了，我是被算法监控到了吗？去看了下，原来是罗老师在B站上批民族主义的新视频又被围攻了。这也太巧了点儿。

罗翔是国内外说中文的在公共场合说过话发表过言论的人物里为数不多入得了我眼的人物了，余皆碌碌不足道。

那些以文人名士自居的，高晓松许知远之流，我大体上都没什么好感，看的书虽多但思想境界浅，作为知识分子不以追求真知真理为目标的，那就仿佛在One Piece的世界里出海的海盗不想当海贼王一样，和咸鱼还有什么区别。中国三千年下来在思想文化上的造诣，与当今世界思想文化的高峰相比，大概就相当于脚踝以下到头顶的距离了。而至今还崇慕国学或者名士的，说是恋足也不为过了。所以我对什么国学经典儒生理想士大夫风流之类的一概不感冒，二十来岁的小青年去欣赏这些还情有可原，四五十岁的人了还止于这个境地那就不像话了。那些记者出身的公共人物，一言以蔽之，思维能力不行，诸如小崔反转基因、柴静采访丁仲礼之类的笑话。而海外民运人士，鱼龙混杂，打包一起用我去年评价艾未未的话：「算个鸡巴」。老一代的民运分子水平普遍不行，鼓噪者众，而有真知灼见者寡，不过是些时代赋予名声的残党罢了。而同时兼有人品的就更少之又少了。

说回事件本身。民族主义为什么是不对的？

道德问题从来不简单。道德哲学是门很深的学问。

民族主义是不是好的？某种意义上来说是的，如果它能帮助你们团体内的增强互信互助，那它就有积极意义。但它是衡量一切事情好坏的终极标准吗？显然不是的。你只要稍微转换一下立场，想象下你是被历史上中国灭掉的小国，你还会赞成汉民族主义这种事吗？用X国的剑为X国的犁取得土地，这不就德国纳粹吗？换着站在别族的立场上，那就是一曲可歌可泣的反侵略赞歌。

道德和正义有层次有大小。为爱人献身，为朋友两肋插刀，为家族争光光耀门楣，为国为民舍生取义，守护世界和平，为遥远大陆素昩平生的人无怨无悔地奉献一生……所有这些，你觉得哪个最正义最光荣？

你是不是以为我会希望你选最后一个？因为他最有大爱，最无功利性地利他？

错！如果一条道德要求过于背离人性只有圣人才能做到，那他就不具备任何普遍意义。你可以自己奉行，但不能去要求其他人。什么是有普遍意义的道德？比如不能随便杀人，否则最后大家都没了。这种一般也叫法律。

所以上面的哪条最正义？我认为他们都一样，没有什么高下，完全可以并行。你为爱人无私奉献，我为朋友两肋插刀，他为国为民劳苦功高，大家都有光明的未来。而当他们冲突时，那就是电车难题，没有定论但普遍实践还是救更多人。

而最不道德的，我眼中纯粹的恶，反而是人们这颗想要强迫别人意志的心。把别人纯粹视为贯彻自己意志的工具，而不是把其他人视为和自己一样有自由意志的人。

狭隘的民族主义和种族主义在精神内核上没什么区别。都是把人视为工具和机械的产物，试图用别人的出身，否定别人的自由意志，强加自己的信念意志于他人身上。

所谓汉奸卖国贼也不一定就真是骂人的话。因为照这样说，二战期间欧洲战场总司令艾森豪威尔那就是名副其实的德奸。所以一样道理，如果同样一个中国人在中国侵略别国时坚持自己的信念义无返顾地和同胞开战，那我不仅不能骂他汉奸，反而要敬他是个汉子。

所以民族种族出身这些都不成其为道德评判的终极标准。道德评判的终极标准是人作出选择时的善良意志。

而这很多时候是只有天知道的。周公恐惧流言日，王莽谦恭未篡时。所以不要轻易评判私人，除非他对你很重要。多把放大镜对准那些事关大家的事情上。

罗翔身上尤让我敬佩的一点是他在国内目前这种高压环境下还在一点一滴地发光照亮更多的人。在这次所谓「翻车」事故中，尽管有无数人在骂他，但他也同样赢得了很多人的支持。事情也不似几年前那样铁板一块。他用身体力行证明了人性和理性可以驱散黑暗，这是让我很感欣慰的一点。

道德是一件极难改变的东西。在某种意义上道德是情感的一种，这种神经回路一旦建立，想要改变可太难了。想象你劝说家里老人改变观念时的困难。那个高中时我们一个宿舍一起背毛泽东诗词的同学现在也还是头像贴着五星红旗的「爱国者」，和我的很多高中同样一样，身上那种爱国情怀多少年过去了也没怎么变。我不批评这种朴素情感，只是想多呼唤一点脑子，在拉黑你多年的学霸同学前，能不能把他当成和你一样有理性有良知的人，说不定他有比你更占理的理由？话说回来，我自己身上这种蔑视权威不盲从认死理的性格何尝不是我道德信念的一种，这多少年过去了不也一样一点儿没变吗。所以听到大数还在沿用我高中时的风评「偏激」时感到熟悉又陌生。

从我走过的很多地方来看，我家乡大概算得上是道德的洼地了。以前我还会说南阳在河南里算好的了，但是音乐节事件以后就说不出口了。彼时的偏激现在看来应该是一种被洼地道德欺负了以后说不清理由的反抗。比方说历史或政治课本上非要你信一些狗屁不通的理论，比如我「人人自私所以人人不能自私」这种反抗集体主义的论断，比如不管你个人实际情况非要摁着你头教你谦虚不服就修理你的霸道。而陌生的点则在于这么多年过去以后，时移世易，我对种种因果渐渐了然，即使我现在的观点不合于主流，我也会有更多地理由相信自己站在有理的一方。而相反的那些我反倒觉得是更多受着（道德）情感的驱使，更加「偏激」。

当然你要说我赢了辩论输了人生，那我当然是毫无还嘴之力。谁的人生不是一场终将到来的失败呢？人生海海，山山而川，不过尔尔。用自己喜欢的方式度过一生。这是关于人生的道德。
