What strikes me most in Kant's *Metaphysics of Morals* is his discussion of our duties to others.

It wasn't until I read Kant two years ago that I first encountered the concept of duties to others.

Before that, I was rather like Sun Wukong—placing my autonomy and dignity above all else. Stubborn by nature, often at odds with the world, absolutely refusing to give anyone leverage over me or allow emotional manipulation.

Though deeply sentimental at heart, I rarely expressed it to others, as if it were a weakness or vulnerability. And indeed it was—meeting the wrong people made me easy to exploit. Once an old friend of ten years swindled me out of some money, and I was so furious I mentally blacklisted everyone from that entire province. The money itself—a few thousands—wasn't much. What hurt more was the loss of a friendship.

Even so, we should still pursue friendship. **The most precious things in life are friends, followed by time.** Both friends and time are worth more than money.

## Perfect Friendship

Perfect friendship seems to exist only in romantic novels—nearly impossible to achieve in reality, relying on chance and rarely reaching perfection. The ship of friendship capsizes easily, and once overturned, can hardly be righted again.

The difficulty of friendship lies in **the tension between love and respect**. Friends must have affinity and maintain attraction; yet they also need mutual respect and appropriate distance—a kind of repelling force.

So perfect friendship is merely an ideal, unattainable. Yet we must pursue it nonetheless.

Since friendship is so contingent, my understanding of the methodology is this:

**First, uphold all the principles of friendship, fulfill all the duties a friend should have, make yourself worthy of friendship, and only then hope to find friends who can understand this kind of friendship.**

Four principles of friendship:

1. Even the best of friends **should not become overly familiar**. Excessive intimacy irreparably destroys respect.

2. **Mutual assistance and benefit should not be the purpose of friendship.** Even when friends help each other, this is merely the external manifestation of inner benevolence, not the purpose or foundation of friendship.

3. Whether helping or being helped, **maintain consciousness of equality**—assist each other as siblings would, not as a benefactor bestowing charity.

4. **Do not put friendship to the test.**

## Bitter Merit

Since reading Kant and Dostoevsky these past two years, I've been trying to practice the idea of loving others. But it hasn't gone smoothly.

The biggest problem is: **What do we do when our good deeds meet with misunderstanding and indifference?**

To be honest, I don't enjoy doing good at all. I know I've never been a good person.

In the past, I most admired Sulla—half lion, half fox—whose motto was: "Help from friends, harm from enemies—I repay both in full."

So whenever my goodwill is misunderstood or my kindness repaid with evil, I immediately fill with rage and want to retaliate.

> I'm a hired servant, I expect my wages at once—that is, praise and the repayment of love with love. Otherwise I'm incapable of loving anyone!
>
> —Madame Khokhlakov, *The Brothers Karamazov*

For someone wicked like me to suddenly reform and seek virtue—you can imagine this entirely unfamiliar path won't be easy.

> Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all.¹

> But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a complete science.¹

Yet this is precisely the true path that Kant and Dostoevsky point us toward.

When our good deeds meet with misunderstanding and coldness, though the feeling is bitter, the moral merit is actually greater, because it more purely demonstrates the strength of our virtue.

> Even if you cannot attain to happiness, always remember that you are on the right path, and try not to leave it.¹

## Love Your Neighbor as Yourself

Honestly, I still don't understand how one can actually love one's neighbor.

> I could never understand how one can love one's neighbors. It's just one's neighbors, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might love those at a distance.²

But loving your neighbor as yourself doesn't mean first stirring up feelings of love in your heart, then helping others through that impulse. Rather, treat doing good as a duty—do good first, and the doing will naturally generate love for others in your heart.

This is practical wisdom.
