I love writing. Writing makes me feel free.

I love writing because it allows me to slow down and think deeply. Socializing with people I can’t connect with feels boring and unrewarding. I despise superficiality in people and things. Everyone has different intellectual strengths. And I’m always drawn to exploring deeper and further. Things that float on the surface and quickly fade away mean nothing to me.

Lately I’ve been feeling creatively drained. All I do is transcribe from books. But that’s meaningless. What matters is personal experience and conviction, suffering and struggle, doubt and defiance... that’s where writing comes alive.

I want to reclaim and refine my writing skills. There’s one book that speaks to me perfectly—*On Writing Well*. Most of it is technical advice, but these three points are what matter most, and they resonate deeply:

## **1. What is good writing?**It is a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength. **Using language to achieve maximum clarity and force.**

From now on, I’ll make this my highest principle of writing.

**Strip away the clutter from every sentence, leaving only the cleanest components.**

Every useless word, every long word that could be replaced with a short one, every redundant adverb, every passive voice construction that obscures the subject—all of these weaken the force of a sentence. You must find the waste in your writing and trim it ruthlessly. Don’t hesitate to cut just because the prose sounds fancy.

But how do you truly free yourself from redundancy? How do you eliminate all filler and deliver pure substance? First, you have to drain the water from your brain.

**Clear thinking produces clear writing.**

Someone with muddled thoughts can’t possibly write well.

## **2. How to write?****Writing is an act of self.** **Write about yourself, and what you write will naturally attract readers.** **Believe in your identity, believe in your perspectives.** **Harness the power of the self.**

Readers can tell when you’re putting on an act.

Too many people think they need to be experts before they can say “I think” or “I want.” Fuck that. Even when a professor lectures me, what I want to hear is their passion—why this subject captivates *them*.

## **3. For whom do you write?**Write for yourself.

**The primary purpose of writing is to please yourself.**

Don’t imagine some vast audience out there. If writing brings you joy, you’ll bring joy to the readers worth having. And if you lose the idiots along the way? You never needed them.

I’ve articulated these principles before. But I need to revisit them periodically, to remind myself to keep going.

We’re prisoners of our own cognition and others’ judgments. For a highly sensitive person, other voices constantly echo in your head. And pride in your identity can be just as constraining, keeping you trapped.

But ultimately, fuck them all.

It is the courage to continue that counts. There is no final victory, no fatal defeat— What’s most precious is the courage to keep moving forward.

Churchill

我喜欢写作。
写作让我感觉自由。

我喜欢写作，还因为写作让我静下心来沉思。
和话不投机的人社交让我感觉无聊收获甚少。
我讨厌肤浅的人和事。
每个人的智力加点是不一样的。
而我总喜欢向更深更远处探索。
浮于表面易于流逝的东西对我而言毫无意义。

近来常感觉才思枯竭。
总是做些抄书的工作。
然而这并没什么意思。
重要的是个人的体验和意志、苦痛和挣扎、彷徨和呐喊……这才是文字的生命所在。

想要重新捡起磨炼一下写作的技能。
有一本书大合我胃口——On Writing Well.
其他的内容都是技巧性的，唯有下面三点重中之重甚得我心：

## 1. 什么是好的写作？It is a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clarity and strength.
**用语言达到最大的清晰和力度。**

今后就把这作为写作的最高原则。

**去掉每一句话里的杂物，只留下最干净的成分。**

每个无用的词，每个可以换成短词的长词，每个重复修饰的副词，每个让人搞不清对象的被动式，都是在削弱句子的力度。
要从文章里找出废话，无情地修剪。
不要因为写得词藻华丽就不舍得砍。

更进一步地，到底怎么样才能彻底从冗余里获得自由？
怎么才能说话不废话都是干货？
答案是先把脑子里的水排出去。

**清晰的思考产生清晰的写作。**

一脑子浆糊的人不可能写好。

## 2. 怎么写？**写作是一种关于自我的行为。**
**写你自己，写的东西就自然会发挥吸引力。**
**相信自己的身份，相信自己的见解。**
**利用好自我的力量。**

读者能看出来你是不是在装。

很多人非得觉得要等到自己是专家了以后，才敢说我想要怎样怎样、想要干嘛干嘛。
但是去他妈的。
就算是个教授来跟我讲课，我想听的也是他满怀热情地跟我们讲，为什么他讲的东西这么吸引他。

## 3. 为谁而写？为自己写。

**写作主要目的是取悦自己。**

不要预想谁是你的广大读者群。
如果你写起来是一种享受，你也会给值得为之写作的读者带来欢乐。
如果你失去傻逼的喜爱，那你本来也不需要他们。

这些原则我以前也写过。
可是每隔一段都要重新确认一遍以鼓励自己继续。

人是自己认知和他人成见的囚徒。
一个高敏感的人脑子里总是不时会回响他人的声音。
而对自己特定身份的骄傲也同样束缚着你冲破牢笼。

但是归根到底，fuck them all.

It is the courage to continue that counts.
没有最终的胜利，也没有致命的失败，
最可贵的是继续前进的勇气。

丘吉尔
