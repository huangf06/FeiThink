## Welcome

Welcome to FeiThink, a bilingual space where I explore philosophy, technology, and the human experience.

## Why Bilingual?

This blog is maintained in both English and Chinese because:

- **Language shapes thought**: Some concepts are better expressed in one language than another
- **Broader reach**: Connecting with readers across linguistic boundaries
- **Cultural bridge**: Sharing ideas between Eastern and Western philosophical traditions

## What to Expect

You'll find content on:

- Philosophical translations and analyses
- Literary works and interpretations
- Personal essays on technology and life
- Cross-cultural reflections

## How to Navigate

Use the language switcher in the top-right corner to toggle between English and Chinese versions of each post. Each article is carefully crafted in both languages, not just machine-translated.

Thank you for visiting!
