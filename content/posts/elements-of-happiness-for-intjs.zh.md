I feel like I'm living too heavily. Even drinking with a Romanian friend before Christmas, I found myself deep in conversation about Chinese society and politics. This sudden realization startled me.

My mind is always occupied with grand, far-reaching thoughts, yet my own happiness never seems to be a concern. This shouldn't be the case.

Looking back, moments of happiness appear to be few and far between. I've spent my life in pursuit of truth, as if I never truly understood what happiness is.

I've decided to make myself happier in 2024.

But I don't have much to go on. General guides to happiness don't really apply to me, mainly because they don't address my specific needs. For example, I can't find any joy in small talk, which makes me wonder if I don't understand the chemistry between people.

This changed when I searched YouTube for videos about INTJs and happiness, and I was immediately struck. Here are some excerpts that resonate with me:

1. Number one thing INTJs need in order to be happy is independence. When it comes to their passion, intuitive thinkers are not afraid to silently distance themselves from the pack in order to follow their dreams.

2. Number two things INTJs need in order to be happy is meaningful relationships. 

Small conversation and phony friends are two of the things that INTJs despise the most in the entire universe. 

You will need to be intelligent, able to participate in meaningful conversations, and trustworthy. 

INTJs have an easy time establishing trust with those they consider friends, and they value those relationships tremendously. The joy that they receive from genuine friendships and solid ties is immeasurable. They are unsatisfied with their relationships with acquaintances. You won’t be able to make them happy if they don’t trust you.

3. Number three thing INTJs need in order to be happy is space. 

This is the best method they recharging their batteries and discovering happiness within themselves. They are unable to do so when they are surrounded by a large number of people who are distracting them. 

4. Number four thing INTJs need in order to be happy is high self-confidence. 

People with the INTJ personality type are naturally self-assured and assertive. The company of confident people makes them joyful, as opposed to the company of persons who are uneasy and act fictitiously. 

5. Number five things INTJs need to be happy is pursuing their passions.

They find happiness in following their hearts or their principles, rather than following the crowd.

Individuals with INTJ personality are fueled and pushed by their passions in all elements of their lives.

6. Number six thing INTJs need to be happy is to be understood.

When INTJ the architect is misunderstood, it is the most annoying thing that can happen to them. 

Unfortunately, for INTJs, their activities are frequently misconstrued by the majority of the population. For example, the INTJ DEATH STARE may be misconstrued as anti-social behavior. 

As a matter of fact, when they realize that someone understands the true meaning behind their actions, they experience a great sense of relief in their analytical minds.

7. Number seven thing INTJs need to be happy is to make plans for the future. 

8. Number eight thing INTJs need to be is honesty. People are real and truthful are more valuable to INTJs than those who pretend to be nice in front of others for their own selfish reasons. People who aren’t afraid to call a spade a spade are the types of people that INTJs enjoy conversing with and learning from. 

This is due to the fact that INTJs despise liars. 

9. Number nine thing INTJs need to be happy is creativity. INTJ the mastermind personality types are well-known for being extremely inventive and creative in their thoughts. 

They are also pleased with themselves when they are able to make things.

10. Number ten thing INTJs need to be happy is a well-organized environment.

Numbers 1, 3, 5, 9 are what I'm currently doing. I'm a natural scholar, and seeking truth is my passion. Thinking and writing are my work, and I enjoy a life of contemplation. Numbers 7 and 10 are part of my daily routine. Numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 are about intimate relationships, about friends and lovers. This is a significant shortcoming in my life, long neglected but crucial to happiness.

So why have I neglected it for so long? Maybe because it's too hard. I've always seen these relationships as things that come if they come, so I've been passive.

Looking at point 2, it's not easy to be a friend of an INTJ; you need to be smart and honest. And having both these qualities is especially hard for Chinese people. The smart ones often have flexible morals, adept at the rules of the jungle, and selfish, making it hard for them to be honest and upright. The honest ones are usually upright but often have rigid worldviews and are intolerant. 

Because it's rare, friendship is even more precious. That's why a fallout with a friend is especially painful for me. I suddenly realized that most of my painful experiences in life have been caused by people from Henan. The Henan colleague who borrowed money and didn't return it, the Nanyang classmate who blocked me over political views. Many charming young men have turned into rogues, and talented individuals have fallen victim to propaganda. It's a sad reflection of how environment shapes people.

As for MBTI, it's a pretty accurate framework. I'm not sure if it's the most scientific personality theory, but it's more than just a Barnum effect or akin to horoscopes. These summaries are specific and not just general statements applicable to anyone. You'll find that the characters in movies, literature, and philosophers you like are often the same type as you. For instance, I like Tywin Lannister from A Song of Ice and Fire and Ivan Karamazov for The Brothers Karamazov; philosophers like Nietzsche and Kant. If you visit the INTJ group on Douband or the INTJ sub on Reddit, you'll find many people whose thoughts align with yours. 

Realizing that you're rare but not unique is important. It means that suitable friends do exist; just we have to find them. In the past, I didn't pay much attention to my feelings, deliberately ignoring my need for friends, and underestimated my own agency. In the future, I hope to make myself happier and more actively seek happiness.

Specifically, this means:

1. Worry less about trivial matters. I've said almost everything I need to. I have no relation to China anymore. I don't want to care about the society and politics there, nor do I want to be disgusted by the discourse in Chinese. Less WeChat, less Twitter, for a more peaceful life.

2. Actively make friends. Europeans are friendly, but those meaningless shallow conversations bore me to death. I've been trying to imitate Europeans for months, but it's tiring and unfulfilling. From now on, I'll change my strategy. And the criteria are well summarized above: honesty is fundamental, a deal-breaker. Life is too short to waste on insincere people. Also, being misunderstood often made me introspect about what I did wrong. Now I think, forget it. Constant misunderstandings indicate a significant gap, making close friendship unlikely, so there's no need for regret. What I lack is the ability to give direct and honest feedback when misunderstood, instead of internalizing the confusion or resorting to passive-aggressive tactics. 

3. Try more happiness-enhancing activities. For INTJs, this includes classes, art, nature, reading, philosophy. I'll make a list of activities that bring happiness, experiment with them, and record my experiences, especially trying new things.

感觉我活得太沉重了。就连在圣诞前和罗马尼亚的朋友一起喝酒的档口，我还在大谈中国的社会和政治。这让我蓦然惊觉。

脑子里整天想些不着边际的大事，但却唯独没有自己，不知道怎么让自己幸福。不应该这样。

回顾过往的幸福瞬间，好像屈指可数。一辈子都在追求真理，仿佛从不理解幸福为何物。

我决定2024年要让自己更快乐一点。

但我又没什么参考。那些面向一般人的幸福指南，大多不适用于我，主要的问题是搔不到我的痒处痛点。比如我就怎么也无法从small talk里获得任何快乐，这让我一度怀疑我是不是不理解人和人之间的化学反应。

直到我去油管上搜关于INTJ和幸福的视频，然后一下就被击中了。下面摘录一些，可以说是我互联网嘴替了：

- 独立。面对自己的热情所在，INTJ们不怕默默远离群体，追随自己的梦想。

- 有意义的关系。琐碎闲聊和虚伪的朋友是INTJ在整个宇宙中最厌恶的两件事。你需要足够聪明，能够参与有意义的对话，并且值得信赖。INTJ很容易与他们认为是朋友的人建立信任。他们对泛泛之交的关系不满。如果他们不信任你，你就无法使他们感到快乐。

- 空间。这是他们充电和寻找内在幸福的最佳方式。当他们被一大群分散注意力的人包围时，他们无法做到这一点。

- 高自信。拥有INTJ性格类型的人天生自信果断。与自信的人相处使他们快乐，而不是与那些不安和虚假行事的人相处。

- 追求他们的激情。他们从追随自己的心或原则中找到快乐，而不是随波逐流。

- 被理解。当INTJ被误解时，这是他们最烦恼的事情。不幸的是，对于INTJ来说，他们的行为通常被大多数人误解。例如，INTJ的死亡凝视可能被误解为反社会行为。事实上，当他们意识到有人理解他们行为背后的真正意图时，他们会感到巨大的安慰。

- 为未来制定计划。

- 诚实。真实和诚实的人对INTJ来说比那些为了自私的原因在别人面前装好人的人更有价值。敢于直言不讳的人是INTJ喜欢交谈和学习的类型。这是因为INTJ憎恨说谎者。

- 创造力。当他们能够创造事物时，他们也会对自己感到满意。

- 井然有序的环境。

其中，第1，3，5，9就是我现在正在做的事。我是个天生的学者，追求真理就是我的热情所在，思考和写作就是我的工作，我喜欢过这样一种思索的人生。第7，10是我日常例行活动，勿需赘述。第2，4，6，8则是关于亲密关系，关于朋友和爱人的。这是我生活里的巨大短板，长期以来一直疏于重视，但又对幸福感至关重要。

那为什么它这么重要我却长期忽视？原因可能是太难了，我过往总是把他们归为可遇不可求的东西。所以总是被动等待。

看看上面的第二点，不难发现要当INTJ的朋友可真不简单，你要聪明，还要诚实。而想要这两点兼备，对于中国人可就太难了。一般聪明的道德灵活，熟练掌握丛林法则，精致利己，所以就难以诚实正直。一般诚实正直的，确实仗义每多屠狗辈，但其世界观往往刻板，就不大宽容异端。前者如借我钱不还的无赖土豪，后者如拉黑我的爱国者们金磊光光。

正因为难得所以更显珍贵，朋友是我们极为珍视的东西，字面意义上的千金不换。这也是为什么朋友反目会让我分外难受。刚忽然意识到我人生里大部分难受经历，都是河南人造成的。借我钱不还的认识十年的河南同事，因为政见拉黑我的是相识近二十年的南阳同学。多少翩翩美少年，转眼间就成了泼皮无赖；昔日美玉高才，也要栽在洗脑宣传上面。让人不禁感慨，还真是一方水土养一方人。

话说回来，MBTI这个理论框架还挺准，具体是不是最科学的性格理论我不确定，但如果你要以巴纳姆效应之类的来解释，把它归为星座一类那确实也是贬低了它。至少上面的这些总结是很有针对性，而并非泛泛而谈换谁都能对号入座的。你发现，你喜欢的影视文学作品人物，多半是跟你一样的类型，比如我喜欢的《冰与火之歌》里泰温·兰尼斯特，《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》里的伊万；你喜欢的哲学家，也多半是和你一样的类型，比如尼采，比如康德；你去豆瓣INTJ小组，reddit上的INTJ sub去逛逛，发现那些人的想法很多也和你不谋而合。

认识到自己只是稀有，而并不特殊，这点很重要。这样至少说明适合我们的朋友是存在的，我们要做的只是去找到他们。过去我总是不太关心自己的感受，刻意地忽视了对朋友的需求，也过于贬低了自己的主观能动性，奉行的是所谓三不原则---不主动，不拒绝，不负责任。今后我希望能让自己更加快乐一些，更积极地使自己幸福。

具体来讲，

- 少操些闲心。该说的都说差不多了。我跟中国没啥关系了。不想再多关心那旮旯的社会和政治。也不想天天被中文的言论恶心到。少刷微信少刷推，日子清净不少。

- 积极交些朋友。欧洲人整体而言友善归友善，但是那种没啥意义的肤浅对话聊久了，也实在把我闷得要死。我这几个月都在试图模仿欧洲人，但是感觉不得要领，有些心累。接下来换个思路，主动拿着地图找朋友。标准其实上面的嘴替帮我总结得很好了，第一就是诚实可信，这一点是基础的，一票否决。人生苦短，没有功夫浪费在虚伪的人身上。第二是聪明。另外是，和人交往时，老被误解这件事，我以往总会反省自己有哪些做得不对的地方。现在我想了想，算求了，老是误会你的，本来就说明你们之间差距极大，很难成为亲密朋友，所以也真没啥好惋惜的。我欠缺的地方是在别人误解时应该直接坦率地正面反馈，而不是暗自纠结甚至曲线救国以牙还牙。

- 多尝试些提升幸福感的活动，对INTJ来说，上课，艺术，自然，阅读，哲学。等我回头列个单子，把所有让人快乐的活动都列出来，挨个实验并且记录，尤其是多去尝试一些没试过的。
