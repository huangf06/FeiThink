Even as grief and rage flood social media, everyone knows things won’t change quickly.

Power remains in the hands of the old guard of this dying era. They will fight to the death to protect their privileges.

Millions protesting for months couldn’t make those in power change course.

Much less a few choked sobs stuck in your throats.

If all they do is punish a few officials, if all they do is issue an apology, nothing will have changed.

As long as the lockdown on speech isn’t lifted, this isn’t over.

As long as this doesn’t establish an ironclad red line, it will happen again.

But that ironclad red line doesn’t lie in laws or armed police.

It lies in your hearts—hearts clouded with grease.

If you meekly surrender your rights and freedoms without a fight, don’t ever claim you’re serving the nation. The nation has no use for spineless descendants like you. Your endless tolerance fattens the parasites, breaks the pillars, and crushes innocent, meritorious heroes to death.

You think you can’t change anything?

That just proves the one who needs changing most is you.

**First: Educate yourself as best you can.**

Stop being so easily fooled.

When you stood on the opposite side of Hong Kong protesters, did you realize? They were demanding exactly what you’re demanding now.

So many people complain that the people are unenlightened.

Setting aside the fact that there are methods in this world to transform barbarism into civilization—you just don’t know them.

More importantly, you yourself are part of that unenlightened mass. Otherwise you wouldn’t be making such claims.

**Second: Do everything in your power to tear down the wall.**

The truth is, many of you *are* the wall itself.

A healthy society shouldn’t have only one voice.

A normal society shouldn’t have only a ruling party—it should also have an opposition party.

If no opposition party is permitted, then there should be rebels.

That’s what a normal society looks like.

If you cowards don’t dare stick your necks out, then fine—keep your heads down and scrape by for food and clothing.

But for god’s sake, stop lecturing others to be “reasonable, moderate, and positive.”

And to hell with “being constructive”—can you constructively make a tyrant step down?

When you wear down the backbone of every person with integrity in this society, you lower society’s moral baseline—because you’re not teaching people cynicism in equal measure, you’re just eroding their courage.

The government will naturally deploy resources to glorify itself. Does it need you speaking on its behalf?

One fewer shameless flatterer singing the government’s praises would make this world a better place.

**Third: You have a vote.**

Some people have real ballots. Some can vote with their feet. What everyone has is attention and money.

Your attention is power. Your bearing witness is power. Your memory is power. Your persistent questioning is power.

Your voice of support or opposition is not meaningless—public opinion monitoring agencies will detect it.

Your lifestyle, your investment and consumption choices, the money you spend and invest—that’s an even more real vote than a ballot.

即便悲愤在朋友圈弥漫，谁都知道事情也不会很快有转机。
权力还握在时代的残党手中。他们必然殊死保护自己的特权。
百万人数月的抗争都不能使权力翻然悔悟。
更不用说你们这只是哽在喉间的几声呜咽。

如果只是惩办几个官员，如果只是一声道歉，那我会认为什么都没有变。
只要对言论的封锁没有解除，事情就没有结束。
只要这件事情没有形成牢不可破的底线，事情就会重蹈覆辙。
而这牢不可破的底线并不在法律和军警。
这底线就在你们一颗颗被猪油蒙了的心。
如果你温顺驯良，拱手而把权益自由出让，千万不要说自己是为国奋斗，国家没有你们这种没骨气的子孙，正是你们的无止境的纵容养肥蛀虫，折断栋梁，砸死了无过有功的英雄。

你觉得你什么都不能改变？
那只说明最需要改变的就是你本人。

**第一你可以尽你所能地教育自己。**

不要再那么轻易地上当受骗。
当你们站在香港人的对立面时，你知道吗？他们和你们现在的诉求一样。
那么多人叫嚷民智不开。
且不说这世上尽有可以变野蛮为文明的法门，只不过你不知道。
更重要的是你自己也是那未开民智里的一员，否则不会如此主张。

**第二你可以尽你所能地推墙。**

事实上，在我看来，你们很多人就是墙本身。
一个健康的社会不应该只有一种声音。
一个正常的社会也不应只有执政党，同样应该也有反对党。
如果反对党不被允许，那就应该有叛军。
这才是正常社会的样子。
你们这些孙子如果不敢出头，那就只可潜身缩首，苟图衣食。
千万不要再去教别人理中客正能量。
也去他妈的建设性，你能建设性地让昏君下台吗？
如果这个社会任何一个有骨气的人被你们磨灭了血性，那么社会的良知水准就被你们拉低了一截，因为你并没有同比例地教会犬儒。
政府自然会调动资源为自己标榜，还需要你们这些人来替它说话？
少一个歌功颂德为政府邀功的无耻之尤，这世界会变得更好。

**第三你有选票。**

有的人有真实选票，有的人可以用脚投，所有人都有的是关注和钞票。
你的关注是力量，你的围观是力量，你的记忆是力量，你的追问是力量。
你支持和反对的声音，并不是毫无意义，会被舆情监察机构发现。
你的生活方式，你的投资和消费，你花出去投出去的钱，则是比选票更真的选票。
