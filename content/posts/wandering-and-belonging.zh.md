## **The Longchang Enlightenment**I was recently moved by a video from Luo Xiang: “Should we persist in integrity or choose worldly sophistication?”

He recounted Wang Yangming’s death: “On January 9, 1529, Wang Yangming died in Dayu County, Jiangxi, at only 57 years old. On his deathbed, his disciples asked if he had any last words. He replied: ‘This heart is luminous; what more is there to say?’ After his death, Emperor Jiajing not only refused to honor his achievements but condemned him, calling his teachings improper and accusing him of inciting chaos. The emperor stripped him of his title and banned the School of Mind. The empirical world offers nothing but repeated disappointments. Only by transcending experience and stepping out of Plato’s cave can we achieve inner coherence.”

The more I’ve experienced, the more I’ve come to see that materialism is fundamentally mistaken. Searching for truth and meaning in the empirical world is a fool’s errand—like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.

Reality is nothing but endless conflict and contradiction. This is what existentialists mean by the absurd nature of existence. The notion that we should “follow natural law” is pure fallacy. External nature is cold, indifferent existence; it’s human consciousness that mediates and interprets the experiential world. The world itself has no color—our senses and consciousness paint it.

There’s a line from an online novel I read in college, *Blasphemy*: “All things in the world, with their myriad colors, are merely the veiled human heart.” Back then I found it striking without quite understanding why. Now I recognize it as an expression of Kantian philosophy, the same insight Van Gogh captured in his paintings.

Luo Xiang continued: “Later, when Wang Yangming served as an official and offended the powerful eunuch Liu Jin, he came to grasp the true meaning of *gewu* (investigation of things). The essence of *gewu* isn’t to understand heavenly principles by studying the external world, but to explore the Way of Heaven by examining one’s own heart.”

## **Home and Freedom**These reflections resonated with me because I’ve been living abroad, recently adrift and purposeless.

*Mountains are hard to cross—who grieves for the lost traveler? Meeting by chance, we are all strangers in a foreign land.*

Why do we spend our lives wandering?

I remember a conversation with Qin Ju at Zijing Cafeteria as graduation approached, talking about what we’d do after college. I said I wanted to throw a backpack on and wander until I found somewhere I liked, then settle down. It was just talk, of course—the day after graduation I reported for duty at a state-owned enterprise back home.

But looking back over the past decade, I’ve somehow been living out that throwaway remark. A prophecy I never meant to make.

The pursuit of freedom. The longing for home.

Freedom drives us to flee places that cannot contain us, to drift and wander. The longing for home kindles hope again and again, propelling us forward.

I recently read *Existential Psychotherapy*, which captured it well: finding a home, a sense of belonging with others in this world, freedom, resistance to oppression, enlightenment, self-realization.

## **Cultures of Love and Hatred**Have I found belonging in Europe? I’d say things are somewhat better.

A rough theory has been forming in my mind: cultures fall broadly into two types—those that cultivate goodwill and those that breed hatred. I’m not entirely certain of this, since purely antagonistic civilizations probably self-destructed long ago. Those that endure must contain some measure of mutual aid; they differ only in degree and scope. The broader the scope, the more civilized the culture. One metric, as economist Yang Xiaokai noted, is unprovoked kindness toward strangers.

I recently saw a question making the rounds on Twitter: If there’s a fire, would you save your eight-year-old cat or an eight-year-old child you don’t know? I tracked down the original post on Xiaohongshu—80% chose the cat, and the comments were nearly unanimous. The coldness, the faint malice toward human life—it was genuinely shocking. I posed the same question to European friends. Some would save the cat, naturally, but most said they’d save the child. This aligns with my experience: in Europe, I occasionally encounter unprovoked kindness from strangers. Looking back on thirty-plus years in China, I struggle to recall even a single instance of such kindness, yet I can easily summon numerous memories of unprovoked hostility.

These seem like trivial observations. But when you grow weary of everything and begin questioning life’s meaning, these small things suddenly loom large. What’s the point of living in a jungle among beasts, even if you’re the jungle’s king?

## **The True Homeland**So we drift and wander, moving from place to place, sampling the world’s different customs and cultures.

But perhaps the ideal state is ultimately impossible to find on earth. Our true homeland may lie in heaven.

Everyone’s ideal world is different. I think of a South African friend—born into a wealthy white family, yet a fervent Maoist. The more concrete our visions become, the more they clash. Those unquestionable moral truths probably exist only at the metaphysical level, like the logic behind “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” A perfect world capacious enough to contain us all can probably exist only in the transcendent realm outside Plato’s cave.

As Luo Xiang quoted: “The individual’s inner self is an experiential thing, mixed with good and evil. We must await a kind of miracle—moving from experience to transcendence, leaping from inside the cave to outside, transcending individual experience. In the experiential world, we cannot draw a perfect circle. But outside the cave, the perfect circle exists.”

## **My Problem**What strikes me most about Europe is that the world finally feels normal—there aren’t so many absurdities violating my will. Away from those troublesome people and situations, the world has grown quieter.

Now the problem is mine alone. In the past, external disturbances drew my attention outward. But now I must face my isolation directly, confront the desolation rising from within, beyond all the noise.

My problem is a severe emotional blockage. I seem to have lost the capacity to feel and desire. I can barely appreciate simple pleasures.

Then there’s my ability to love. As someone who learned to treat life as a survival game, I’m not afraid of hostility—I’m accustomed to malice, even expect it. But what truly disarms me is unprovoked kindness and joy. These are foreign to me. They leave me at a loss.

I can’t help lamenting that the life lessons I absorbed in my first thirty years were all wrong. The cultural difference between love and hatred I described earlier is rooted in assumptions about human nature. To assume everyone else is bad while making yourself the sole exception—this is philosophical cowardice. The complexity of human consciousness lies in how our assumptions about others are projections of our own self-conception. As the saying goes: “How others see you doesn’t represent who you are, but how you see others does.” Take that survival-first mentality: assuming others are bad doesn’t mean you’re bad, but it does reveal that your vision of others is a projection of the dog-eat-dog worldview you yourself have internalized.

Perhaps this is the cure for my emotional blockage: presenting myself honestly, practicing unconditional love. Choosing sincerity and integrity after weathering life’s storms—not because “suffering loss brings blessings,” not even out of some utilitarian hope for reciprocity, but from self-respect. To give others the greatest respect is to respect yourself, to respect the projection of your own consciousness.

**龙场悟道**

最近被罗翔的一段视频触动——「做人到底是坚持正直，还是选择圆滑世故」。

“公元1529年1月9日，王阳明病逝于江西大余县，在一个州内，年仅57岁，临终之际，弟子问他有何遗言，他说此心光明，亦复何言。王阳明去世之后，嘉靖不仅没有论其功绩，反而降旨怪罪，说其学术不端，聚众祸乱，停了他的爵位，并将阳明心学定为禁学。经验世界，原本就只有一次又一次的失望，跳出经验，走出洞穴，我们才能获得内心的自洽。”

经历越多，愈知唯物主义皆误。想从经验的世界探寻出真理，寻出些意义，实在是缘木求鱼。

现实就只有无尽的冲突和矛盾。这就是存在主义者们所说的世界荒诞本质。所谓道法自然尽是谬论，外在自然不过是冰冷存在，而人的意识是对外在经验世界的调和。世界本身全无色彩，是人的感官和意识为他们赋予了色彩。

“世间万物，缤纷色彩，不过是被蒙蔽了的人心罢了”。当年大学时看的网络小说《亵渎》里的一句话，原来只不明觉厉说不出个所以然，而今重想起来，这是康德的哲学思想，是梵高的绘画表达的东西。

“王阳明后来为官，得罪大太监刘瑾，他开始明白了格物的根本意思。格物的本质不是通过对外在世界的探究来认识天理，而是对个人内心的认识来探究天道。”

**家和自由**

这些之所以触动我，盖因我最近身在海外又丧失了目的和意义。

关山难越，谁悲失路之人；萍水相逢，尽是他乡之客。

我们一生漂泊，到底所为何事？

想起本科将毕业时和覃莒在紫荆食堂聊起毕业后想干什么，我说毕业后想背个包去云游，然后找到一个自己喜欢的地方就定居下来。当然也就说说而已，毕业第二天就回了老家国企报到。

但回顾自己十余年的人生轨迹可谓是在亲身实践这个戏言，一语成谶。

对自由的追寻，对家的渴望。

自由驱使我们不断逃离那些容不下我们的地方去漂泊流浪，对家的渴望又不断使我们燃起希望再出发。

上本《存在主义心理治疗》里萨特总结得不错：找到一个家，在这个世界上与他人共同的归属感，自由，反抗压迫，启蒙，自我实现。

**爱和恨的文化**

那我在欧洲找到归属了吗？可以确定的是好一点。

最近冒出一个笼统粗略的想法：世上文化大体分为两类，一类生成善意，一类激发憎恨。但也不确，因为全然互害的文明大概都自己湮灭在历史长河，能够留存下来的多少还是需要有其互助的部分，差别大概就是互助程度上的差异，其所覆盖的范围。覆盖范围更广的，更接近文明一些。一个观察指标是杨小凯先生曾经提到过的对陌生人无缘无故的善意。

最近看到推上转的一个问题：发生火灾了，你养了八年的猫和一个不认识的八岁小孩，你救哪个？为此我特意去小红书上原贴看了下，80%救猫，评论则几乎清一色。其折射出的对人的冷漠和淡淡恶意，还是着实让人震惊。我问了欧洲的朋友，当然也会有人救猫，但多数还是救人。跟我观感相似，在欧洲时不时会收到陌生人的善意，而回顾三十余年的国内生活，则几乎完全回想不起一例，无来由的恶意则能想起很多。

说来这些都是不起眼的小事，可是当你哪天突然厌倦一切质疑起生活的意义时，这些小事就突然变得意义重大，感觉生活在丛林里与野兽为伍殊无意义，哪怕我是丛林之王。

**真正的家园**

漂泊流浪，不断从一个地方换到另一个地方，见识这世界不同的风土人情。

但理想国大概终究难在地上觅见，我们真正的家园在天上。

理想的世界是千人千面的。有感于一位南非的朋友，他出身富裕的白人家庭，但狂热地支持毛主义。越具体的东西就越容易相互冲突，那些唯一无可怀疑的道德真理大概只能在形而上学层面了。类似于“我不同意你的看法，但誓死捍卫你说话的权利”的逻辑结构。能把我们全部容纳的完美世界大概也只能存在于洞穴之外的超验世界里了。

“个人的内心是一种经验化的东西，里面有善与恶的混杂，人们必须等待着一种奇迹，从经验走向超验，从洞穴跃至洞外，跳出个体的经验。在经验世界中，我们画不出完美的圆，但在洞穴之外，完美的圆是存在的。”

**我的问题**

在欧洲最大的感受是世界终于正常了，没有那么多强奸你意志的幺蛾子了。远离了那些烦扰的人和事，世界平和了不少。

现在的问题是我自己的。过去有外物干扰的时候，你的注意力都被吸引过去了。而现在则终于需要直面起自身孤独的处境，直面喧嚣以外从内心升起的荒凉了。

我的问题是我严重的情感阻塞，好像丧失了感受和愿望的能力。难以欣赏感受廉价的快乐。

然后是爱人的能力。身为丛林的生存玩家，自己是无惧风刀霜剑的，面对恶意是见惯而无畏的。但是戳中我软肋的恰是没有来由的善意和快乐，这些是陌生和让我不知所措的。

不由感慨前半生所学的做人学问尽误。前面讲到的爱憎文化差别，根源全在于对人的假设。把别人都假设成坏人，唯独自己是例外。这是一种哲学上的弱鸡。人的意识复杂之处就在于自己对别人的假设是自我意识的投射。所谓“别人眼里的你代表不了你，而你眼里的别人才代表了你”。以上述的生存哲学为例，不是说把别人都假设成坏人说明你就是坏人，而是你眼里的别人形象正是你自己所信奉的生存哲学的投射。

我觉得这或许是拯救我情感阻塞的一剂良方，以坦诚的自我示人，实践无所求的爱。真诚正直是我们历经千帆的选择，原因不是什么“吃亏是福”，甚至都不是功利性的希望被别人同样对待，而是出于自我尊重，给别人以最大的尊重即是在尊重自己，尊重自己的意识映射。
