## **1. Good and bad are artificial constructs**I hurt someone with my words at Mark’s wedding. Afterward, I kept turning the whole thing over in my mind, trying to figure out some universal code of conduct. Eventually, through some mental pathway, I arrived at this:

This world has no good or evil, only cause and effect.

Good and bad are artificial constructs.

— Rick and Morty

So-called good and evil are just human-made concepts.

Since they’re human-made, how do you know the people who invented these concepts are any smarter than you? I see far too many absurd ideas that crumble under scrutiny.

If they’re truly reasonable, fine — we can embrace them. If not, then every absurd notion becomes fair game for mockery.

As Teacher Deng of Hegelian philosophy once said: if something can’t be extended into a universal principle, it doesn’t deserve respect.

Don’t dismiss this as just another platitude. If it’s true, then every persona we’ve constructed needs to collapse and be rebuilt from scratch.

For example: Are those who condemn Li Xiaolu somehow more virtuous than her? As Yan Gongzi put it, “Seeing her so happy in that video, dancing like a young girl — I just can’t bring myself to hate her.” Does it really make sense to use fictional moral concepts to obstruct someone’s real happiness?

Or consider this: Are those “good people” who do nothing but wait for heaven’s judgment guilty themselves? At least evil people actively scheme toward their goals, while the good just sit there. When I watched *In the Name of the People*, I could never condemn Qi Tongwei, who tried to outmaneuver fate, but I felt genuine anguish watching Chen Yanshi protect his reputation while letting evil flourish. (Don’t even get me started on the Hou Liangpings, those arrogant bastards.) Whether violent or peaceful, I instinctively side with rebels — they have more spine than “good citizens” who sit idle while their country gets stolen out from under them.

Nation and ethnicity, bloodline and kinship, public order and propriety, the tide of history, the will of the people, the future of society — nothing possesses inherent legitimacy.

If I reject my own race and bloodline, I can shed my skin and change my heart — reinstall my operating system. If the morality and ethics others taught me are wrong, I can build my own system from scratch. Even laws must earn my recognition to deserve respect.

That line from *Heroes Legends* (Yingxiongzhi) — “thus abandoning the heart of good and evil” — takes on a different meaning today.

The significance of this is no less than the control panel for the hosts in *Westworld*.

If we remove all human-made restrictions, what’s left to constrain us?

Will. Imagination. Intellect. The limits of nature.

*die Freiheit des Geistes*. Free spirit.

## **2. Take reality for a ride**When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride. But it’ll never stop trying to throw you. And eventually it will. There’s no way off.

— Rick and Morty

#### **How do we leap onto the horse’s back?**Smart people use their intellect to see through to the truth. While others struggle and moan under reality’s iron hooves, they wake up, seize the mane, leap onto the horse’s back, and grip reality by the neck. Intelligence is the only reins. The day we’re thrown off is the day we begin to decline and die.

#### **How does reality throw us off?**I often wonder: if not for ourselves and other people, how could reality defeat us? One is material, the other spiritual. How can physical blows inflict spiritual damage?

Setting aside objective factors like bodily or mental dysfunction, what else could unhorse us? Experiments in discovering truth? Attempts at achieving goals? Without the gaze of others or ourselves, why would these even count as failures? It’s precisely the accumulated interpersonal wounds and self-doubt that make us let go voluntarily.

Ask yourself:

Do you have the courage to stand alone against thousands? Can you withstand hundreds of challenges and still trust your judgment? When friends and loved ones let go and dismount, will you follow or keep gripping the reins? Can you ride on alone when there’s no one left like you? Can you spot the hidden assumptions when others dispense their “wisdom”? Can you stay unmoved when others shove their petty achievements in your face? Can you remain calm when others judge you by their values and logic? Can you stay true to yourself when friends, lovers, and family weaponize emotion? Can you hurt someone and feel no guilt, knowing the inevitability of it? Can you watch people come and go without flinching? …

The world has treacherous peaks. Only those with iron resolve can reach them.

## **3. Who am I? What do I do?**[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r8Ft!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F327578c7-630b-47e0-a159-fdbffdc5c514_1024x640.jpeg)

Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.

## **1. Good and bad are artificial constructs.** 遂舍善恶之心我在Mark婚礼上出口伤了人。其后我反复琢磨整件事，想要想出一个普适性的行为规范。最后不知怎么个脑回路蹦出了下面这么一句：

这世界没有善恶，只有因果。

无独有偶，就在第二天我在《瑞克和莫蒂》里看到了一句一样意思的台词：

Good and bad are artificial constructs.

Rick and Morty

所谓善恶不过都是人造的概念罢了。

既然是人造的东西，你怎么知道造出这些概念的人比你更聪明？
因为在我看来实在是有太多荒谬经不起推敲的玩意儿。

如果他们确实有道理，我们服膺守善则可；
如果没有，那任何荒谬的东西都是我们嘲弄的对象。

正如黑哲邓老师所言：如果不能推广成某种普遍性的准则，那就没有尊重的必要。

不要把这仅仅当成又一句普通平常的大道理。
事实上如果这话成立，那我们的所有人设都要崩解以重新审视。

举个例子：
那些指责李小璐的人就比她更高尚吗？正如燕公子所说『看见她小视频里高高兴兴手舞足蹈像个少女，我就没办法讨厌她』。用虚构的概念去妨碍别人真实的幸福，当真站得住脚吗？

再比如那些无所作为只等天降审判的好人是不是有罪呢？如果恶人都知道积极地想方设法达成目的而好人只是干坐着。以前看《人民的名义》我始终无法苛责想胜天半子的祁同伟，却切齿痛心于爱惜羽毛放任恶行的陈岩石。(侯亮平两口子这种傲慢的狗杂碎就不说了)。
无论暴力还是和平，我都天然地心向反贼，因为我总觉得他们比那些坐视窃国逆行的良民更有种。

国家民族、血统血缘、公序良俗，时代的潮流、人民的意愿、社会的前途……没有什么东西有天然的正当性。

如果不屑于自己的种族血缘，我可以把自己剥皮换心，改装操作系统；如果认为别人教我的道德伦理都是错的，我可以自己重建一套适合自己的。就连法律也要经由认可否则就不值得尊重。

《英雄志》里那句『遂舍善恶之心』今天读来又有了别样的意味。

事实上，这件事的意义不亚于《西部世界》里机器人的控制面板。

如果我们把一切人为的限制都移除，那么约束我们的还剩下什么呢？

意志，想象力，智力，自然界限。

die Freiheit des Geistes. 自由精神。

## 2. **Take reality for a ride** 逍遥游When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours.
Smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride.
But it'll never stop trying to throw you.
And eventually it will.
There's no way off.

Rick and Morty

这世界以平庸的人为食。
只有聪明人有机会跳上马背。
现实会不断试着把你甩下来。
最终你会被甩下来。
没有其他的路。

#### 我们是怎样跳上马背？聪明人通过自己的头脑看清真相。
当别人还在现实的铁蹄下挣扎呻吟时觉醒过来，抓住马鬃跳上马背，搂紧现实的脖颈。智识是唯一的僵绳。
当被甩下马的那天，就是我们的衰老和死期。

#### 现实又如何把我们甩下来？我常疑心：如果不是自我和同类，现实怎么能击败人？
毕竟一个是物质，一个是精神。物理攻击怎么能造成精神伤害？

抛开肉体或精神的功能障碍这种客观因素，还有什么呢？
发现真相过程中的一个个试验？
完成目标过程中的一次次尝试？
如果不是来自同类或者自我的目光，这些为什么会被当成失败？
我觉得正是一次又一次的人际挫折和自我怀疑，让我们自愿松开了手。

问问自己：

你有孤身对抗万千的勇气吗？
你能抵挡千百次的质疑仍然相信自己的判断？
在你的朋友爱人松手下马的时候你是跟他们一起还是始终抓紧缰绳？
你可以在没有同类孤身一人时独自前行？
你能在别人跟你传授经验时分辨出其中的预设和前提？
你能在别人拿他们微不足道的成就戳你脸时无动于衷不被带偏？
你能在别人用他们的价值和逻辑评价你时不被激怒也不动摇？
你能在熟人朋友爱人家人以感情为诱饵为要挟时依然故我？
你能伤害别人以后知悉其中的必然性因而毫无负罪？
你能坦然面对人来人往？
……

世有险峻，非心性坚忍者不能至。

## 3. W**ho am I? What do I do?**Take off.

出发吧。
Put a saddle on your universe.

给你的宇宙套上马鞍。看它会变成什么样。
Let it kick itself out.

看它会变成什么样。
