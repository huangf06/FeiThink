Last Friday, I felt deeply unsettled—restless and troubled. I went home early, but my frustration had nowhere to go.

The usual distractions offered only temporary relief, ultimately hollow. Better to read something—something difficult.

I recalled a Reddit thread where someone asked for book recommendations, and I had replied with *The Brothers Karamazov*. Someone commented underneath suggesting *The Idiot*.

Though Dostoevsky is my favorite writer, I’ve actually only read a few of his works. So that was it—time for *The Idiot*.

I spent two full days reading through all 500,000 characters of *The Idiot*.

My mind raced with thoughts throughout, and the impact lingered even more powerfully afterward. Though there are a thousand things I want to say, I can only articulate two or three. I’m writing this down now while the feeling is still fresh in my memory.

When I read about the Prince’s kindness toward the orphaned girl Marie, I was moved to tears by the Christ-like love he embodied. Perhaps it’s age—I’ve come to better understand what’s truly rare and precious in this world.

The world is full of toxic masculinity that refuses to shed tears, full of survival philosophies that never show weakness, full of hot tempers that demand tenfold revenge for every slight. What’s scarce is a gentle, forgiving heart. And even within this scarcity, fleeting moments of compassion are relatively common—what’s truly rare is a consistent, principled commitment to benevolence and forgiveness.

In *The Brothers Karamazov*, Dostoevsky teaches us: love concrete people, not abstract humanity.

But loving concrete people is so difficult. It always brings misunderstanding, rejection, hurt, and pain. There are thick walls between human beings, and everyone carries their own excessive pride.

How strong must one’s inner world be to dissolve all resentment and love people the way Christ did?

And what good does all that effort even do?

In the novel, the Prince—despite his perfect character—ends up a complete idiot anyway, unable to save anyone.

There’s no benefit. No worldly advantage whatsoever.

It’s purely a matter of beauty. Moral beauty.

Let me use a small example I saw on Reddit: someone asked how to respond when a woman says “I have a boyfriend.”

The situation may be trivial, but it reflects a universal phenomenon about interpersonal rejection. Especially when you had no such intentions to begin with—then there’s the added sting of being misunderstood.

Do you beat her up like those Tangshan thugs? Or do you snap back with sarcasm, making her realize “I’m not interested in you,” putting her in her place?

After scrolling through the replies, I found the best response was still: “Of course, should’ve known”—and then stepping back.

Tit for tat, sharp confrontation—naturally that would feel satisfying. But when you truly understand the source of someone else’s predicament and pain, anger might not be your first reaction. Because that defensive response has been trained into her by who knows how many terrible experiences.

This is what makes the Prince extraordinary. When others see the heroine Nastasya, they’re simply stunned by her devastating beauty. But what he sees is the spiritual torment she bears.

When you’re young, how could you possibly grasp the profundity of Christ’s spirit? Someone strikes your left cheek, and you offer the right one too—it seems utterly absurd.

Yet it’s Christ’s spirit that has prevailed through to our age. Perhaps, deep in the human heart, there’s a longing for this kind of unconditional, selfless love.

I’ve spent a long time studying moral philosophy, questioning the standards of good and evil, interrogating the meaning of human existence. So far, only Kant’s moral theory has convinced me. And what lurks in the shadows cast by Kant’s moral system is the spirit of Christ.

Where do human moral sentiments come from? What’s the benefit of being a noble person?

If knowing how to read the room, being flexible and expedient, climbing the social ladder, pursuing power, and indulging in pleasure—if this is the proper way of the world, then why can’t I muster even a shred of respect for such people?

Some people in high positions hold grudges to an extreme degree (I’m talking about Fa Zheng)—someone insults them once and they hand down an eighteen-year sentence. They can mobilize all the world’s resources to heal their childhood wounds, impose their will at any cost, make their word into law.

Shouldn’t such a person represent the ultimate expression of this “proper path”? But is there anything worthy of respect in that? Is there any beauty?

You can’t explain the nobility and wretchedness of character from a utilitarian standpoint.

The beauty of morality lies precisely in going against the current.

**Why is Christ’s spirit precious?**

Our society is flooded with moral judgments blind to others’ struggles. Most of these are selfish and hypocritical—lacking any universal significance, they’re essentially a form of privileged arrogance, people passing comfortable judgment from positions of advantage.

What about those who fall outside these countless circles, large and small? Do they forfeit their right to be human? If saying they’ve “lost their qualification as human beings” is too extreme—only applicable to the most extreme cases—then feeling morally bound and inferior is probably the normal condition of ordinary people.

What makes Christ-like love precious is that it offers a safety net for those who suffer. Ordinary people’s love is conditional, because their circles of moral judgment have boundaries—some so narrow they barely encompass themselves.

But Christ-like love is unconditional, capable of embracing more people (I originally wanted to write “all people,” but then I thought: can it embrace the devil? That’s a question. So I changed it to a comparative—just a bit more than ordinary people is good enough).

Even if you’re alone in the world with no one to rely on, there’s still someone who loves you unconditionally, expecting nothing in return.

You might say, “I’m not that wretched yet.” Then you probably don’t understand existential loneliness. Those who aren’t lonely rarely possess religiosity.

I’ve never thought much of my university’s motto: “Virtue sustains all things.”

When you hear “virtue sustains all things,” can you picture a concrete example? Is it like Liu Bei or Song Jiang? Fake benevolence and phony righteousness. Mouths full of morality and virtue, hearts full of calculated self-interest.

But Prince Myshkin in *The Idiot* suddenly brought this phrase to life for me, giving me a living example.

What “sustaining all things” really means is bearing others’ suffering. Put more simply: because you’ve been drenched by rain, you want to hold an umbrella for others. It’s the same idea. Drawing on our own rich experience of suffering, we offer spiritual support to other lost souls—so that at least they’re not alone on the path of pain.

Selfless love isn’t without its rewards.

We become richer, feel fulfilled, grow less lonely.

By helping others, we help ourselves.

By caring for others, we ourselves are cared for.

Redemption.

上周五心里很不宁静，烦乱。早早回了家，但满腹郁闷无处发泄。

寻常排遣不过打发一时，终究无味。不如读书，读些难读的书。

想起在红迪(reddit)上别人求荐书的贴子下我回复了《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》，有人在我的回贴下跟贴《白痴》。

虽然陀斯妥耶夫斯基是我最喜欢的作家，但我其实没读过几本。那就它了。

花了整整两天时间读完了五十万字的《白痴》。

读的过程思绪万千，看完了后劲儿更大。腹中虽有千言，能说出来的不过二三。趁着感觉的短期记忆还没消散，提笔记下。

读到公爵对待孤女玛丽的种种时，被公爵身上那种基督式的爱感动到流泪。许是年纪大了，更能理解这世上什么东西更稀有可贵。

世上多的是有泪不轻弹的有毒雄性气质，多的是不示弱的生存哲学，多的是以牙还牙十倍奉还的气性，稀缺的是温柔宽恕的心。而这其中，一时的恻隐之心常见，而一贯的成体系的仁恕之道不常见。

在《卡》里陀翁教导我们：爱具体的人，而不是爱抽象的人。

可是爱具体的人有多难。总是和误解拒绝伤害痛苦相伴。人和人之间的厚障壁，人们各自过剩的自尊心。

到底要有多强大的内心，才能化解一切怨念像基督那样的爱人。

而且费这一切的劲儿有什么好处吗？

书里这样人格完美的公爵最后还不是成了一个彻底的白痴，谁也没有能够拯救。

没有好处。没有什么现世的好处。

纯粹是一种美感。道德上的美感。

举个很小的例子来说明，是我在reddit上看到一个问题，怎么回应女生说「我有男朋友了」？

事体虽小，但是反映的是一个普遍的现象，关于人际中的拒绝。特别是当你根本没那个意思的时候，那就更夹杂了被误解的委屈。

是像唐山的兄弟们一样给她打一顿？还是抢白嘲讽她一下，让她认清「我对你没兴趣」这个现实，摆正她的位置？

我看了一圈回贴，发现最终还是“Of course, should've known”（当然，早应该知道了）然后退开，这个回应最佳。

以牙还牙针锋相对自然解气。但是从根源上理解别人的困境和痛苦，可能就不会第一反应是生气了。因为对方这样一个反应不知道是被多少次糟糕经历训练出来的结果。

这就是公爵的过人之处，别人看到女主娜斯塔霞时只会震撼于她颠倒乾坤的美，可他从中看到的却是她所承受的精神痛苦。

年轻时哪里懂基督的精神高明在哪里，别人打你的左脸，你把右脸也伸过去，简直荒唐。

可截至我们的时代，胜出的就是基督的精神。大概人的心底呼唤这种无条件无所图的爱。

我花了很长时间研究道德哲学，质问善恶是非的标准，拷问人活在世上的意义。目前能说服我的唯有康德的道德学说。而在康德道德体系的背光里潜藏的是基督的精神。

人的道德情感究是从哪里来的呢？做个高尚的人有什么好处呢？

如果说懂得顺应时势，经权达变，在社会阶梯上攀爬，追求权力，享乐纵欲是人间正道的话，何以我对这样的人内心升不起一丝尊重？

有的人身居高位睚眦必报（我说的是法正），别人骂他一句就要把人判个十八年，可以动用世上的一切资源来疗愈自己的童年，不惜一切代价贯彻自己的意志，言出法随。

这样的人难道不应该是「正道」的极限了吗？但是这里面有任何值得敬重的地方吗？有任何美感吗？

人格的伟大和卑劣，你从功利的角度是没有办法解释的。

道德之美就在于它的逆流而动。

**基督的精神为什么可贵？**

在我们的社会上充斥了看不见别人苦衷的道德评判。而其中大多数都是自私虚伪的，因不具有普世意义故而本质上是某种形式上特权的傲慢，因为自己站在有利位置上就心安理得地评价别人。

而那些落在这样大大小小的圆圈之外的人该何以自处？从此就丧失了做人的资格吗？如果说人间失格是言重了，只适用于那些极端状态的话。那感觉被道德束缚低人一头，可能就是凡人的常态了。

基督式的爱可贵之处就在于，为这些受苦的人兜底。凡人的爱是有条件的，因为凡人判断好恶的圆圈是有边界的，有的边界甚至小到只能容纳自己一人。

而基督式的爱是没有条件的，可以容得下更多人（我本来想写所有人，但转念一想，容得下魔鬼吗？这是个问题，所以改成比较级，比凡人多一点就好）。

哪怕你在世上无依无靠孤独一人，这世上仍然有人无条件无所图地爱你。

你说我还没这么惨呢。那你大概还没理解存在性的孤独。不孤独的人很难有宗教性。

我一直不怎么看得起我们学校的校训「厚德载物」。

就是说起「厚德载物」，你脑子里能想象出一个具体的形象吗？是刘备、宋江这样的吗？假仁假义。满嘴都是仁义道德，心里全是利益算计。

但《白痴》里的梅诗金公爵，忽然就让我想起这句话，给了我这样一个样板。

所谓载物，承载的是他人的痛苦。通俗点讲是因为自己淋过雨，所以想给别人撑把伞。意思上接近。以我们丰富的受苦经验，给其他迷途之人以精神支持，至少在受苦的路上不孤独。

无所求的爱并非没有回报。

人会变得丰富，感到自我实现，减轻孤独。

通过帮助别人，从而帮助了自己。

通过关爱别人，我们自己也得到了关爱。

救赎。
