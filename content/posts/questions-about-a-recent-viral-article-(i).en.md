Lately I’ve seen far too much nonsense—stuff that shouldn’t fool anyone—hoodwink far too many people, including those who are highly intelligent, well-educated, and experienced in practical affairs.

I’m writing this to set the record straight and inspire more discerning minds to engage in deeper thinking and discussion.

The Hong Kong situation is crystal clear: it’s about mainland China squeezing Hong Kong’s freedoms and rights.

Bringing up economic factors or mainland-Hong Kong tensions is missing the forest for the trees.

Hong Kong’s unique position rests on its status as a free port with an independent judiciary and a free business environment. Cross-border kidnappings—events the mainland refuses to report—would be major scandals with severe consequences in any society governed by the rule of law. Yet to this day, those who authorized these actions hide behind the scenes like cowardly turtles, acting as if nothing happened. No one has been held accountable or offered any explanation. They broke the rules but escaped punishment because of their power. This is what lawlessness looks like.

When people argue with me that China *is* a rule-of-law society, this is my most solid evidence to the contrary: law that cannot constrain power is not rule of law.

Pushing patriotic education (which is really Party loyalty education) and compressing Hong Kong’s freedom of expression is another major driver.

(Why does patriotism conflict with freedom? Because the Party-state weaponizes patriotism to suppress inconvenient speech and dissenting political views. Gossiping about leaders does no harm to the nation; exposing corruption actually serves the country’s interests.)

Why do mainlanders find it so hard to empathize?

Is it really so hard to imagine what it feels like to have freedoms you were promised suddenly stripped away?

In the end, it all comes down to whether you actually own two cows or not.

Mainlanders remain indifferent to the erosion of free speech and academic freedom simply because most have never experienced such freedoms in the first place.

Why am I so sensitive to this? Because the commentators I follow—and I myself—get censored all the time. (And why do I always end up liking views that get banned? Because I’m smart, obviously. Smart within limits—I can’t conjure pork out of thin air, but I can at least smell it cooking.)

A thought struck me this morning: throughout all of Chinese history, the military has never belonged to the nation. And naturally, there’s been even less experience successfully constraining power through institutions.

So those who fear democracy and freedom have their reasons—such things have never existed here. No one can say with certainty what would happen if that day ever came.

After all, these are just frameworks. Whether they actually work depends entirely on the people operating within them.

Based on my limited understanding, I’d rank rule of law first, education second.

Education is actually the most important, because sophisticated, efficient forms of social organization go against our animal instincts—they need to be trained into us. But on reflection, I can only rank it second.

Why? Because I’ve seen with my own eyes how education becomes a tool for poisoning youth when the system itself is lawless, and how the Party deploys the full power of the state apparatus with sophisticated tactics to consolidate its rule.

The real educational crisis in China today isn’t that Hong Kong lacks patriotic education—it’s that the mainland desperately needs civic education. People need to learn how to actively shoulder social responsibility, express opinions constructively, analyze and debate issues critically, communicate and compromise to find solutions, and organize and collaborate effectively.

But the Party-state does the exact opposite: it restricts free speech, prevents spontaneous citizen organizing, dismantles all non-official social groups, and works tirelessly to build an atomized society.

Over the past ten-plus years, I’ve watched Chinese society firsthand. I’ve seen enormous amounts of material, financial, human, and intellectual resources sitting idle, churning uselessly, going to waste.

Back in middle school, our politics textbook attacked capitalist electoral systems, pointing to the chaos and resource waste of elections. But look at the reality today: when a Chinese leader takes power, they must first spend years purging political enemies and consolidating their grip. Compared to that massive social cost, the seamless transitions in Europe and America are basically free. Not to mention that Trump faced impeachment over a phone call to an ally, while our leaders can screw up at every turn and still barrel ahead unopposed.

There must be a more efficient way to organize society, and a real path to get there.

(Why am I so sure? Because you’d be hard-pressed to imagine anything more incompetent and pigheaded than what we’ve got now. Sure, reality can always surprise you—we’ll see. And yes, history has plenty of even stupider examples. But until you live through it yourself, it’s all just stories.)

I haven’t figured it out yet. So I’m certainly not going to run around shouting slogans.

I originally set out today to critique two pieces:

- Deutsche Welle journalist’s video interview with Shao Lan

- Lu Kewen’s “The Hong Kong Issue and the Truth About the World”

I’ve seen a few rebuttals of the second one, but they all miss the crucial points, and I’d look lazy just forwarding those. Haven’t seen anything on the first one yet. I meant to write my own critiques today, but just getting through this preamble has taken me to the late hours. I’ll leave the rest for next time.

*(To be continued)*

近期看到太多本以为不值一哂的玩意儿唬住了太多人，包括各种高智商、有智识、通实务的人。
写文以正视听，启发更多有识之士做更深入的思考和探讨。

香港这事情非常明白的是因为大陆挤压香港的自由权利。
扯经济原因、港陆矛盾都是分不清主次。 
香港之所以位置独特就在于它是个自由港，有独立的司法和自由的商业环境。
跨境绑架这种事大陆不给报道，但是放在法治社会就是影响恶劣的大事件。时至今日，始作俑者却躲在背后缩头乌龟，跟没事人一样。没有人承担责任给个说法。坏了规矩却因为权力不受惩罚，无法无天。 
我说中国不是法治社会有人跟我争，这就是我最坚实的论据，关不住权力的法律谈不上法治。

推动爱国主义(实为爱党)教育压缩港人自由空间也是一大动因。
(为什么爱国主义跟自由有冲突？那是因为党国借爱国之名压制不利言论和政见。写个领导人的花边新闻无损于国家；爆出贪腐更是有利国家整体的事情。）

大陆人为何如此难以共情？
对给出去的自由权利被剥夺这种事真的这么难以感同身受吗？
说到底不过就是是不是真有两头牛罢了。

大陆人对言论自由和学术自由被挤压这种事无动于衷，说到底不过是因为大部分人根本不曾享有过罢了。
我为什么对这如此敏感？不过也是因为我喜欢的论者，以至我自己，屡屡被禁言。（至于为什么我总是喜欢会被禁的观点？那当然是因为老子聪明了。当然聪明得有限，因为我还变不出猪肉，但是至少能闻出肉香。)

早上想到：中国自有史以来还从来没有过军队属于国家的时候。当然也更没有把权力关进笼子里的成功经验。
所以那些恐惧民主自由的人有他们的道理，因为这种事在这片土地还没有发生过。谁也说不好，那一天真的来了会是什么样子。
毕竟那些说到底都只是框架，是不是真的能发挥出效力完全取决于体系运作中的一个个人。

所以在我现在粗浅的认知里，我首推法治，其次是教育。

教育是最重要的，因为高阶高效的组织方式是违反动物性本能的，需要加以训练才能掌握。但我想了想还是只能放在其次。
因为我眼见目睹在非法的体系下教育如何荼毒青年，党如何动用国家公器的力量、精巧的手段稳固自己的统治。

当今中国教育问题并不是要在香港加强爱国主义教育，而是需要在大陆推行公民教育。教大家如何更积极地承担起社会责任，如何正确建设性地表达言论，如何分析讨论辨别事理，如何沟通妥协达成解决方案，如何更高效地的组织协作。
但是党国现在的做法恰恰相反，限制言论自由，防范公民的自发组织协作，限制拆解所有非官方的社会组织，致力于构建一个国民原子化的社会。

十余年来我耳闻目睹中国社会现状，我看见大量的物力财力人力智力资源被闲置空转浪费。
我上中学时政治课本批判资本主义选举制度时的一个论据是选举过程中的混乱和财力的浪费。但是反观当今社会现实，一个国家领导人上台以后首先要花数年时间来清除政敌稳固权力。相比这些巨大的社会代价，欧美那种无缝切换的交接简直就是零成本。更不用说川普给盟国打个招呼就面临弹赅，而我国步步踏错还能继续一意孤行。
一定存在某种更高效地社会组织方式，以及实现这种组织方式的切实路径。
(我为什么如此笃定？实在是你很难想象有比特么现在更不学无术刚愎自用的玩意儿了。当然现实总会超出人的想象，拭目以待。更当然的，历史上有过太多更傻逼的。但是你不实际经历都只当故事看了。）
而我现在还没有想明白。所以我肯定不会去鼓噪呐喊什么大口号。

我本来今天主要想批驳的两篇是：
德国之声记者采访邵岚的视频
和
卢克文的香港问题和世界真相
下面这个看过几篇反驳文章但都感觉抓不住要点，懒省事转发有损逼格。上面那个还没看到。今天本想亲自动笔，但是写个前言就已经太晚了。留待下篇。
